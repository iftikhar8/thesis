# AMSA 2018 Conference Abstract

## Theme: G2 LIFE-HISTORY AND CONNECTIVITY IN THE OCEAN
This session will have a biological perspective on the life history of marine organisms and their connectivity between habitats and across oceanic spheres. Presentations on population dynamics of marine species, in both near and offshore regions, and on migrations of marine species in the course of their life cycle are welcome. This includes how connectivity can improve the management and conservation of marine organisms. Presentations on functional connectivity, such as benthic-pelagic coupling, fit into this session as well.

## Abstract
The black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) is a large, long-lived reef fish of the family Serranidae, found mostly along the NSW coastline. Listed as a threatened species since 1983, due to population declines from fishing pressure throughout the 20th century. However, this protection has not resulted in population recovery. The aims of this study was to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii* along its known distribution, identifying strong areas of potential settlement. Using a biophysical dispersal model, larvae were released during April-May (2004-2011) from known areas of aggregation and tracked to settlement sites (both reefs and intertidal rocky shores). The results predicted high local retention and self-recruitment for Solitary Islands, Nambucca and Port Stephens, suggesting sustaining these populations are critical to persistence of juveniles in these regions. Connectivity was predicted to occur between the offshore populations and the NSW coast, suggesting genetic, if not demographic, connectivity exists. Further research is required to determine if juvenile populations can be predicted by the model, noting that post-settlement processes were not considered. This study provides insights into the connectivity of black cod along NSW, which can be utilised by conservation managers to aid in the recovery of this vulnerable population.
