### Abstract
The black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) is a large, long-lived reef fish of the family Serranidae, found mostly along the NSW coastline. Listed as a threatened species since 1983, due to population declines from fishing pressure throughout the 20th century. However, this protection has not resulted in population recovery. The aims of this study was to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii* along its known distribution, identifying strong areas of potential settlement. Using a biophysical dispersal model, larvae were released during April-May (2004-2011) from known areas of aggregation and tracked to settlement sites (both reefs and intertidal rocky shores). The results predicted high local retention and self-recruitment for Solitary Islands, Nambucca and Port Stephens, suggesting sustaining these populations are critical to persistence of juveniles in these regions. Connectivity was predicted to occur between the offshore populations and the NSW coast, suggesting genetic, if not demographic, connectivity exists. Further research is required to determine if juvenile populations can be predicted by the model, noting that post-settlement processes were not considered. This study provides insights into the connectivity of black cod along NSW, which can be utilised by conservation managers to aid in the recovery of this vulnerable population.

## Outcomes and significance of project

The general aim of this project was to predict the connectivity patterns of a protected species of NSW, the Black Cod, using a coupled biological-physical model. Simulating larval release across its known distribution over a period of 7 years allows us to infer strong areas of source and settlement for *E. daemelii*. The prominent threat to the NSW black cod population is from hook and link fishing, along with less specific threats such as climate change and water pollution [@nswdpi2012]. Due to the total ban on fishing black cod since 1983, the current fishing-related threats to population recovery are primarily by-catch (or unintended catch) and illegal fishing. Protecting black cod involves firstly, protecting known (and potential) areas of aggregation of mature sexually active *E. daemelii* adults from fishing pressure to maximise the reproductive output of spawning populations and secondly, habitat protection for the intertidal, rocky reef and estuarine habitats it uses throughout its lifecycle [@harasti2013]. Black cod exist in different sized populations, in the NSW marine parks (i.e. MPAs) and in two of the Commonwealth reserves [@pogonoski2002]. For MPAs to be effective, protected areas must be connected, exhibit strong local retention [@botsford2001; @botsford2009], and protect quality habitat [@cabral2016]. Many of these MPAs were established in 2002 and there has been a fishing ban on *E. daemelii* since 1983, yet there has been no sign of population recovery [@francis2016]. One potential explanation is that the current MPA network is not optimal for *E. daemelii*. Unfortunately, there is little information on the connectivity of *E. daemelii* [@francis2016] against which to assess the MPA network, hence the purpose of the study.

*E. daemelii* larvae spawned from regions across their known distribution, showed strong spatial differences in settlement patterns driven by a latitudinal gradient. The nearshore EAC has a strong influence on connectivity patterns, moving larvae southwards, but cross currents and mesoscale eddies also provide some northwards connectivity. There was annual variation observed between the settlement patterns, driven by changes in hydrodynamics, but this is typically less than the spatial variation seen between regions. Four communities were identified from the potential connectivity patterns; northern, central and southern coastal communities, and another community containing the offshore reefs. The strongest settlement from each region along the coast was commonly to the source region, i.e. local retention, or the regions geographically above and below. Weak connectivity was predicted to occur between all coastal regions and the offshore reefs. Each of these identified communities, from the known distribution or populations, contained MPAs. This work serves to identify regions where additional protection could aid in the recovery of *E. daemelii*. The first is to increase the amount of sanctuary zones in the strong connectivity regions with known aggregations, e.g. Solitary Islands and Nambucca. As well as likely candidates for currently unknown populations, such as the northern areas of Ballina and Yamba and the central regions of Newcastle and Sydney.
