# Travel grant for the ICES ACS conference

## Brief motivation (500 words max)

(attend international conference)
My motivation to attend the ICES ACS conference is to meet peers and disseminate my work from my PhD. Undertaking research in Australia, isolates you geographically from the rest of the world. This isolation can make it difficult to meet others who have a keen interest in your work and also are involved in similar topics. ICES ACS offers a fantastic opportunity to remove this barrier.
As such, coming from Australia also makes it expensive to travel while not on a scholarship.

(share work)
The ambition to share the output from my PhD, specifically the data from my empirical chapter, detailing the effectiveness of MPAs showing connectivity of an endagrered endemic fish species of New South Wales, Australia.


I look forward greatly to the chance of interacting with other researchers who have produced connectivity models in Theme Session F and beyond.

(networking)
The conference will also be a great way to network, with the hope of meeting future researchers with which to pursue a post-doctoral position with.
