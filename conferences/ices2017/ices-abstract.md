Our study investigated the larval connectivity patterns of the Black Rockcod (*Epinephelus daemelii*), an east-Australian temperate reef fish. *E. daemelii* is categorised as a threatened species under Australian legislation. Protection is offered to the *E. daemelii* through the Temperate East Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network. *E. daemelii* are most abundant at off-shore reefs and islands, populations which have limited ability to migrate to avoid adverse environmental changes. This species has a small home range, thus the ability for migration occurs during its pelagic larval stage. We modelled larval connectivity patterns to determine how well the established marine reserves network protects this vulnerable species. We also investigated if they will still be effective in a world of global change, by determining how robust the connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii* were to annual changes in oceanographic currents. Our final aim investigated the sensitivity of these connectivity patterns to known gaps in our knowledge of the early-life history for *E. daemelii*, e.g. exact spawning times and pelagic larval duration.
