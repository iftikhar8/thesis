Title: Modelling the connectivity of the black cod (Epinephelus daemelii): is there overlap with the current MPA network?

The black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) is a large, long-lived reef fish of the family Serranidae, found mostly along the New South Wales (NSW) coastline. Listed as a threatened species since 1983, due to population declines from fishing pressure throughout the 20th century. However, this protection has not resulted in population recovery. The aims of this study was to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii* along its known distribution, identifying potential strong spawning regions and regions of strong settlement. Using a biophysical dispersal model, larvae were released during April-May (2004-2011) from known 19 known regions across its distribution and tracked until settlement (both reefs and intertidal rocky shores). The current marine protected network in NSW (and Commonwealth waters) has effectively been in place since 2007 and many regions legislated marine reserves even earlier, noting that the size of no take zones within each marine reserve varies. Despite most known *E. daemelii* populations occurring within marine reserves, the overall population numbers do not appear to be increasing. One explanation is that the current reserve network does not meet its objectives for *E. daemelii*. Using the modelled connectivity, we can predict areas where *E. daemelii* could benefit from additional protection. This study provides insights into the connectivity of black cod in the NSW region, which can be utilised by conservation managers to aid in the recovery of this vulnerable population.
