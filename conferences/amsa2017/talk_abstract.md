## Title
An analysis of current trends in connectivity modelling and comparisons of movement behaviours of ichthyoplankton.

## Abstract
Biophysical connectivity modelling has consistently used by marine researchers over the past twenty years for estimating connectivity patterns. The outputs of these models have been used for everything from assessing population dynamics to aiding the design and testing the effectiveness of marine protected areas. However, the evolution of biological models have not kept pace with the physical models. Physical models have been progressively improving through utilising higher resolution satellite data and enhanced algorithms. The advancement of the biological models has been slower, with many studies that investigate the connectivity of pelagic marine larvae still implementing the larvae without behavioural traits. We reviewed the current literature (2010-2016) on connectivity driven biophysical models to compare how the implemented biology affects the output. In addition, we discuss how modelling different movement behaviours of pelagic ichthyoplankton influences connectivity patterns based on the results of a recent theoretical study we undertook. These outcomes allow us to understand both the behaviours to prioritise in the implementation of biophysical models for future connectivity modelling studies, and where to focus our efforts in finding unknown information about biological traits of the modelled marine larva.


Need to talk about the review . 
What we found.
Where biophysical models are going . 
Why so many use passive movement still
What biology is being implemented
The talk about the theoretical chapter. 
What did we find regarding the movements in our study. Which ones effected the output more. Was there differences in implementation? 
Is there a priority in implementing behaviors?  Do some effect the output more than others ... 
Where should researchers be focusing efforts in models and where should studies be concerned with collecting data on early life history stages . 
From here we can advance the field to produce better connectivity models as standard
