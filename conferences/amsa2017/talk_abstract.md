## Title
Putting the bio(logy) back into biophysical connectivity modelling.

## Abstract
Biophysical connectivity modelling has been a popular tool amongst marine researchers for estimating connectivity patterns, having been consistently used over the last twenty years. The outputs of these models have been used for everything from assessing population dynamics to aiding the design and testing the effectiveness of marine protected areas. However, the evolution of biological models have not kept pace with the physical models. Physical models have been consistently improving by utilising higher resolution satellite data and enhanced algorithms. The advancement of the biological models has been  slower, with many studies investigating the connectivity of pelagic marine larvae still implementing the larvae without behavioural traits. We reviewed the current state of connectivity driven biophysical models in the literature (2010-2016) to compare how the implemented biology affects the output. In addition, we discuss how modelling different movement behaviours of pelagic ichthyoplankton influences connectivity patterns, using results from a recent theoretical study we undertook. These outcomes allow us to understand both what behaviours to prioritise implementing in biophysical models for future connectivity modelling studies, and where to focus our efforts in finding unknown information about biological traits of the modelled marine larva.


Need to talk about the review . 
What we found.
Where biophysical models are going . 
Why so many use passive movement still
What biology is being implemented
The talk about the theoretical chapter. 
What did we find regarding the movements in our study. Which ones effected the output more. Was there differences in implementation? 
Is there a priority in implementing behaviors?  Do some effect the output more than others ... 
Where should researchers be focusing efforts in models and where should studies be concerned with collecting data on early life history stages . 
From here we can advance the field to produce better connectivity models as standard
