Hello. My name is Steven Hawes, I'm from the University of Sydney, undertaking a PhD.
I hope you have all thoroughly enjoyed this conference as much as I have. This is the second half of a talk I gave back in 2015, at the Geelong conference. So I apologise if it sounds like something you may have heard before. Although, as I'm speaking on the last day, potentially no one is paying too much attention anyhow.

# What is a biophysical connectivity model?

Combination of biological model with physical model.

Mature modelling technique - been used 30 years (first published in 1988)
---
# Why are they useful?

PROs:
Can estimate patterns of connectivity over spatial and temporal scales that empirical studies do not allow for.
Cheap.
Allow us to investigate how different parameters effect connectivity.

CONs:
Element of faith in the results.
Models are only as good as the information you put in.

# Estimating connectivity

We are interesting in the BIOLOGY.
(It makes increasingly little sense to not include the biology)
[Show the connectivity picture]

---
# Ever increasing complexity

Models are getting more complex
- Increased computing power
- More empirical studies reflecting ability of larval fish
---
# Aims of the meta-analysis

To understand what input parameters

Last major review was in 2007 (Miller).

# Methodology

Searched connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS (Dates 2009 - 2016)
* Found 77 studies published in 34 journals
* Looking at marine species with a pelagic larval stage and sedentary adult phase

# Connectivity terms
| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-recruitment    | The percentage of settlers to a site, that (regardless of their origin site) were natal to that site.                                                                                           |
| Local retention     | The percentage of the larvae natal to a site that recruited back to that site.                                                                                                                  |
| Settlement success  | The percentage of recruits natal to a site that recruit to any site.                                                                                                                            |
| Dispersal kernel    | The probability density function of the dispersal distance for the larvae released in the system.                                                                                               |
| Connectivity matrix | A matrix with columns specifying *i* natal sites and rows specifying *j* settlement sites, showing the probability of a larva spawned at site~*i*~ that settles at site~*j*~ at position~*ij*~. |

# Yearly trends

Show the years graph.

???
As you can see it peaked in 2012 and has been declining since for reasons unclear. Hopefully model validation.
Similar yearly trends as the Miller review, consistent publications.
