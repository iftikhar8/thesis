<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Biophysical models are an increasingly popular tool in studying marine population connectivity. These models offer the ability to perform analyses of connectivity patterns over temporal and spatial scales that are not possible with empirical techniques. In addition, biophysical models allow for the investigation of the early-life history traits of marine species that influence connectivity. The proliferation of biophysical transport modelling studies should allow for analysis of emergent general...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Biophysical models (also known as coupled physical-biological models) have become a popular tool in advancing our understanding of the connectivity patterns of various marine species {SanvicenteAnorve:2014bl}{Koeck:2015bf}{Andrello:2014ge}. These models are not a new technique, biophysical models first started appearing in the literature almost 30 years ago {Bartsch:1988vg}. It is an area of research that is increasing in its popularity. A review of the 17 year period between 1989-2006 found 69 ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Metric consistency and reporting</strong><br/>A trait common to nearly all biophysical connectivity studies is that they are attempting to estimate at least one of two fundamental and general patterns; 1) levels of  connectivity between natal and settlement sites and 2) dispersal distance of particles in the system generally. The first is essentially a measure of larval source-sink dynamics, looking at patterns of production and settlement in marine species that inherently links one patch in the system to another. The second is a measure of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Models and reproducibility</strong><br/>Reproducibility, a term often synonymous with open science, is an important facet in assessing the scientific merit of a published paper. It can be difficult to achieve in large empirical studies due to experimental variance {OpenScienceCollaboration:2015cn}, however, the same challenges do not exist in computational modelling {Peng:2011et}. Ideally for reproducibility, the model configurations, source code and the output data is made available at the time of publishing. Transparency provides bo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A common approach</strong><br/>In order to provide transparency and allow for useful comparisons between connectivity studies using biophysical models, we need a common approach to publishing both methods and results. We identified two main problems in the literature with connectivity studies preventing us from making meaningful comparisons. The first is a lack of commonality of  derived connectivity metrics amongst studies and incomplete reporting of metric values used. The second is the lack of reproducibility and clarity o...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>If we are going to advance our understanding of connectivity in marine systems, biophysical modelling studies need to start publishing consistent quantitative metrics of dispersal and connectivity so that comparisons can be made. Studies must also provide more transparency on the parameters used. We have attempted to provide a template for the basic information we think necessary based on our review. We suggest this template be used as the basis for discussion amongst scientists in the field but...</p>
