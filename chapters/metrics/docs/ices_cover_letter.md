Dear Editor

We are please to submit our paper, “A quantitative & reproducible approach for biophysical connectivity models“ for consideration for publication in the ICES Journal Of Marine Sciences Special Issue “Beyond ocean connectivity: new frontiers in early life stages and adult connectivity to meet assessment and management challenges”.  We have submitted this a “Food for Thought” piece though would happily take your recommendation if you think it better suited for “Quo Vadimus” as it would also probably fit this criteria.

This paper resulted from a review of the literature on biophysical connectivity modelling studies (59) over the past six years in which we rigorously documented all aspects of the input and output parameters as well as the geographic, taxonomic and modelling environments.  Our initial goal was to see what a meta-analysis could tell us about some of the really important questions in biophysical connectivity studies.  These are questions such as the importance of including various larval behavioural mechanisms or how turbulent diffusion is handled.  However we quite quickly realised that while such synthetic understanding should be possible, it was being limited by a lack of consistently in the reported metrics and a lack of transparency about model parameters.  In the submitted paper we summarize the state of these issues within the papers reviewed and, importantly, summarize their effects and what we believe is a way forward. 

We think the issues we raise are, to an extent, limiting progress in a field replete with excellent individual studies.  The message of our submission is that the discipline as a whole would benefit greatly from more coordination in outputs reported.  We feel this is a timely message and very appropriate for inclusion in this special issue as the widespread adoption of biophysical connectivity studies to inform conservation and management initiatives requires a level of generality of process and certainty in results that we may not currently be able to provide.  We would hope this paper could serve as a starting point for a larger conversation about consistency in reporting for the benefit of all.  We hope you find our submission useful and appropriate and look forward to your response.

Regards,


Steven Hawes
