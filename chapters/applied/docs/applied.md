# CHAPTER: Larval connectivity of Black Cod *Epinephelus daemelii* along the south-eastern coast of Australia and implications for conservation


# Introduction

AIMS:

1. To investigate the realised connectivity patterns from known spawning locations
2. To investigate the realised connectivity patterns from their known distribution?
3. How do the current marine parks fit in with these patterns of connectivity?

# Methods

For detailed methods of the biophysical dispersal model used, see Chapter 3.


STUDY LOCATION

Black cod larvae were spawned between April-May 2004-2011 from 76 coastal reefs (grouped into 19 regions; MAKE FIGURE) along the breadth of New South Wales, matching the known distribution and spawning times (CITE Harasti). The spawning regions ranged from the Tweed down to Eden, and included Lord Howe Island and the offshore reefs Elizabeth and Middleton. For each reef, 1000 larvae were spawned daily over the 61 day period, 18.5 million larvae were released breeding season (148 million over the course of the simulation period).  Black cod were allowed to settle to reefs defined by benthic data obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). In addition, reefs for Norfolk Island and New Zealand were included as potential settlement sites, as per their known distribution.

- short continental shelf


## Physical submodel

The oceanographic current data was obtained from BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; Oke:2013dm], see Chapter 3 methods for a complete description.
