Larval connectivity of Black Cod *Epinephelus daemelii* along the south-eastern coast of Australia and implications for its conservation and management
=======================================================================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

In marine systems, spatially discrete populations can connected to each other through larval exchange. This connectivity (exchange of individuals between populations), provides both demographic (immigration) and genetic (gene flow) functionality and is fundamental to the viability of marine populations. Connected spatially structured populations are called metapopulations, and the volatility of the dispersal connecting these populations can have important ecological and evolutionary repercussions [@hanski1998; @sale2006a]. Metapopulation dynamics are driven by connectivity variation, i.e. the number of individuals exchanged, the direction of the exchange, the distance of dispersal, and the genetic makeup of new recruits [@figueira2009].

Connectivity has often been overlooked when designing marine protected areas in favour of protecting habitat [@crowder2006]. Global change in the time of the anthropocene, means designing well connected MPAs is important for ensuring resilience of marine metapopulations from threats such climate change, overfishing and diseases [@almany2009; @botsford2009]. Well connected MPA networks can satisfy the objectives of both conservation and fisheries management [@gaines2010; @christie2010]. Understanding and measuring connectivity within a marine metapopulation is critically important in order to design effective networks MPAs, with optimal locations, size, and spacing.

For marine species, this connectivity often occurs primarily during a pelagic larval phase. This is true for many reef fish, which often have sedentary adult phases and therefore connectivity only occurs during this pelagic larval phase. The larval dispersal is a complex process, driven by physical (i.e. ocean currents, turbulence) and biological (i.e. growth, development, and swimming behaviours) processes [@cowen2009]. Recent empirical understanding has identified this transport is not passive advection by ocean currents and turbulent systems. Larval development allows for larvae to influence their dispersal through behaviours such as vertical migration [@paris2004a; @irisson2010] and sensory abilities which larvae can use to orientate and swimming towards settlement sites [@faillettaz2015; @berenshtein2014a]. Measuring this connectivity is difficult using empirical methods, which have spatial and temporal limitations. Instead, biophysical dispersal modelling is useful tool to estimate connectivity using oceanographical models coupled with biological models, which have less limitations on predicting connectivity over large spatial and temporal scales [@roberts2010; @paris2013; @kool2015].

Black cod, *Epinephelus daemelii* (Gunther, 1876), also known commonly as the black rockcod, the saddled rockcod, and the potted black grouper, a large grouper of the teleost family Serranidae, is one such species with a pelagic larvae stage contributing to its dispersal. *E. daemelii* is native to Australia and New Zealand in the south-western Pacific Ocean. Its known distribution ranges from eastern Australia (southern Queensland down to Bass Strait) to Northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, with populations on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs [@froese2017; @zotero-2862]. Along eastern Australia, the black cod is primarily distributed along the temperate waters off the New South Wales (NSW) coastline. Adults live in the caves and crevices found on rocky reefs at depths of up to 50 m. Post-settlement juveniles are found in rock pools and shallow reef intertidal habitats, migrating to estuaries as they grow older [@harasti2014a; @francis2016]. *E. daemelii* can reach the age of 65 years, grow up to 170 cm total length (TL) and weigh 80 kg. Like many large groupers, its a protogynous hermaphrodite, with protogyny not occurring until the fish reaches lengths of over 100 cm (TL), which occurs at approximately 25 years of age [@francis2016]. *E. daemelii* spawn pelagic eggs with a pelagic larval stage estimated to last 60 days [@francis2016]. Anecdotally they are thought to spawn April-May, as this is when aggregations have been seen on the north coast of NSW (@harasti2017, personal communication, 9 March).

*E. daemelii* has traditionally been under fishing pressure in Australia, considered a trophy fish for spearfishers and as a valuable food species for commercial and recreational fishers [it was commonly sold at the Sydney fish markets; @francis2016]. The biological factors of long life span, late sexual maturity, (anecdotally) aggregate spawners, have specific habitat requirements, and sedentary/curious behaviour, make *E. daemelii* vulnerable to fishing pressure. Declines in populations were first noticed in 1916, and the species was listed for protection in 1983 in NSW due to dwindling numbers, with notable population declines during the rise in popularity of spearfishing in the late 1960s and 1970s [@pogonoski2002]. Black cod is currently listed as "Near Threatened" on the ICUN red list [@iucn2006] and listed as "Vulnerable" under the Australian Commonwealth *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act* since 2006 [@departmentoftheenvironment2018]. Although it has been protected since 1983, signs of population recovery have not been seen, with it still missing from many habitats where it was known to occur in prolific numbers [@harasti2013].

Due to the total ban on fishing black cod, the current fishing-related threats to population recovery are primarily by-catch (or unintended catch) and illegal fishing. Protecting black cod involves firstly protecting known (and potential) areas of aggregation of mature sexually active *E. daemelii* adults from fishing pressure, allowing strong reproductive output. Total fishing protection since 1983 has not increased the abundance of *E. daemelii* to previous known levels [@francis2016], suggesting more sanctuary zones within MPAs could be useful to limit by-catch, illegal catch, and any mortality that stems from catch and release. Fish populations with such k-selected life histories are sensitive to low levels of fishing mortality, even within no-take reserves [@Abesamis:2016bc]. The K-selected life history of *E. daemelii* makes population recovery is a slow process, the current NSW black cod recovery plan has a 20 year goal to de-list it as a vulnerable species [@nswdpi2012]. Secondly, there has to be habitat protection for the intertidal, rocky reef and estuarine habitats it uses throughout its lifecycle [@harasti2013]. Marine protected areas are a useful management tool to conserve and grow exisiting *E. daemelii* populations, protecting them from fishing pressure within no take areas and keeping essential habitats protected from development. Black cod exist in different sized populations, in the NSW marine protected areas and a few of the aquatic reserves, along with two of the Commonwealth marine protected areas [Cod Grounds and Lord Howe Island Marine Reserve; @pogonoski2002].

The optimum amount of coastline to protect black cod populations can be measured by the fishing pressure faced, both recreational and commercial [@botsford2009]. Its also understood that for sedentary species with larvae that can disperse long distances, such as the black cod, contiguous MPAs can be more effective when comprising coastline twice the dispersal distance [@botsford2001]. However, in contrast the size of the protected coastline for protecting adult black cod can be small, due to its limited movement as an adult [@Green:2014ct]. For a population to persist, local retention is important, therefore creating MPAs within regions that exhibit high local retention is crucial [@botsford2009], Although, some simulation studies have shown protecting quality habitat areas (i.e. carrying capacity) for rock cod is more important than preserving sites of connectivity [@Cabral:2016cr]. Therefore the most important way to protect *E. daemelii* populations is to protect all known adults populations, potentially increasing the areas of sanctuary zones containing suitable black cod habitat and protecting more intertidal (post-settlement larvae) and estuarine (juvenile) habitats. Protecting habitats (which cannot move) also safeguards against the potential of moving fish populations with warming oceans, seen for many tropical species along the NSW coast [@figueira2010; @verges2014], although increased competition with tropical species is also another risk factor for *E. daemelii*.

The first aim of this chapter is to investigate the potential connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii* using a biophysical dispersal modelling approach. To observe the effects of spatial and temporal variation on the potential connectivity patterns, the biophysical dispersal model utilised eight years (2004-2011) of hydrodynamic data, releasing larvae across its known distribution. Strongly connected regions and potential sub-populations within the known distribution were identified. Comparisons were made between the potential dispersal patterns when releasing across the entire known distribution and from only known areas of aggregation. The second aim is to understand how the current network of marine protected areas, both Commonwealth and NSW, align with areas of high settlement, local retention and spawning success from the derived connectivity patterns. These connectivity patterns, from both known aggregations and using the entire known distribution, can inform management decisions about possible areas of protection to aid the recovery of the *E. daemelii* population.

### Study location

The study area for the biophysical model covered the known distribution of *Epinephelus daemelii* [@francis2016], along the eastern coast of Australia and the offshore reefs; Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (@fig:release-regions). The coastal region of New South Wales (NSW) consists of a narrow continental shelf, with a boundary current, the East Australian Current (EAC), which strongly influences dispersal in the region with its poleward direction and by the mesoscales eddies it generates [@suthers2011]. The study area was divided into 19 spawning regions, 17 approximately equally sized regions (~125 km of coastline) along the NSW coast, and two off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs. Within each region, areas of approximately equally sized sections of contiguous reef were demarcated as specific reef patches. In total there were 560 reef patches in the model domain with about ~25 reef patches per region, except the offshore areas which were considered one continuous reef (as per Chapter 3). Elizabeth and Middleton reefs were considered one region due to local proximity and strong local demographic connectivity, and are thought to be a single stock [@vanherwerden2009]. *E. daemelii* were allowed to settle to other areas within their known distribution that were not used as spawning sites due to their distance from eastern coast of Australia, the small size of populations or they are considered non-breeding, i.e. Queensland, Victoria, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand [@francis2016]. While all specific areas of spawning are not known, the largest known populations within the model domain occur at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca (Fish Rock), Port Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton reefs [@harasti2013].

![Location of rocky reef patches used for spawning *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae in each of the 19 regions along the coastline of New South Wales, Australia and the offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth reef and Middleton reef (EM reefs)](chapters/applied/figs/release-sites.png){#fig:release-regions}

Within the model domain I identified 20 marine protected areas that were relevant to *E. daemelii* habitat (ignoring most protected areas in Commonwealth waters more than three nautical miles from the coast of Australia as they do not contain black cod adult or juvenile habitat and fishing pressure on larval fish is considered to be negligible). The MPAs fall under two jurisdictions, the NSW Government (18 MPAs) and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (2 MPAs). The 18 NSW MPAs consist of six marine parks known to occur within the modelled domain (Cape Byron Marine Park, Solitary Islands Marine Park, Lord Howe Island Marine Park, Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Jervis Bay Marine Park, and Batemans Marine Park) and 12 aquatic reserves. In addition, the Commonwealth MPAs which are located within the model domain were considered, Lord Howe Commonwealth Marine Reserve (which contains Elizabeth and Middleton reefs), and Cod Grounds Commonwealth Marine Reserve (@fig:release-regions). Information on the size of the MPA and sanctuary zone areas of current marines parks was sourced from the NSW Government (http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/marine). The NSW MPAs have four different levels of protection within; sanctuary zones (no take areas), habitat protection zones (recreational fishing and some commercial fishing allowed), general use zones (recreational and commercial fishing allowed), and special protection zones (reserved for traditional Aboriginal use). For the two Commonwealth MPAs of interest, recreational and commercial fishing is only allowed by permit (and commercial fishing permits do not extend to within two nautical miles of Elizabeth Reef).

### The biophysical model

Connectivity patterns of *Epinephelus daemelii* were estimated using the ZISSOU biophysical dispersal model (BDM; v1.1.3; @hawes2018), see Chapter 4 methods for a complete description. ZISSOU is an individual based model, moving larvae within the system using a coupled biological-physical model. Larvae are advected within the model domain using output from a hydrodynamic model and turbulent processes. The biological model applies traits (i.e. pelagic larval duration, developmental rates) and behaviours (i.e. ontogenetic vertical migration, orientated horizontal swimming) that influence the dispersal. If an individual larva reaches suitable habitat before the end of its pelagic larval duration it settles, no post-settlement processes are considered.

The physical model was forced with hydrodynamic flow data from BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; @oke2013], a data-assimilating hindcast model which resolves mesoscale eddies with mean daily velocities. BRAN3 has a resolution of 0.1° latitude and longitude, and resolves depth velocities at bins of 5-10 m. As with similar studies [@condie2016; @chiswell2011], an eddy diffusivity value (K) of 300 ms^-1^ was implemented in the model. Larvae positions in the BDM were updated based on a time step of two hours.

The biological model was parametrised with values obtained from the literature for the species *E. daemelii* where possible. In the cases where values could not be sourced for a particular parameter, values for similar species or averages across species within the genus were used instead. If this was not possible, then general values from the review in Chapter 2 were utilised (@tbl:bio-params).

Larvae were released from four reef patches per region daily (chosen ad-hoc, unless specific reef patches were known to contain sightings of black cod), during the hypothesised spawning months April-May [@harasti2017], over eight years (2004-2011). For each reef patch, 4000 pelagic eggs were spawned per day (16,000 per region) over the 61-day period. In total, 18.5 million eggs were released each breeding season and 148 million over the course of the experiment. Larvae were allowed to settle to rocky reef & rocky intertidal patches if they came within the settlement buffer distance of 7 km, after the settlement competency window and before the pelagic larval duration (@tbl:bio-params). A settlement buffer [settlement sensory or sticky water concept; @andutta2012] is a common concept used in many BDM studies (refer to Chapter 2) and helps overcome the coarseness of the hydrodynamic model (~10 km), whereby inevitably some reefs will fall outside the physical model domain as the grid structure is mapped to the contours of the coastline.

The pelagic larval duration (PLD) assigned for individual larvae was sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 60 days and a standard deviation of 10 days (@tbl:bio-params) to account for the empirical uncertainty in PLD values and considering PLDs recorded for other *Epinephelus* species [@lara2009; @jackson2014; @wilson1999]. Larvae were given a non-settlement period of 40 days, during which they were considered not developed enough to settle. A daily larval mortality rate of 10% was applied randomly to all swimming larvae, similar to that used for reef fish in other connectivity studies (seen in the meta-analysis from Chapter 2).

The larvae undergo four stages of ontogeny; hatching, preflexion, flexion and postflexion (@tbl:bio-params). During the hatching stage they are considered passive as they remain within the egg. Once hatched (preflexion), larvae start developing behavioural traits. The age of ontogeny is specified using days, and the specific value was sampled from Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of one day to account for natural variation in developmental times.

While it is unknown if black cod larvae exhibit ontogenetic vertical migration, at a family level Serranidae (including subfamily Epinephelinae) have been seen to show patterns of downwards vertical migration with ontogeny [@irisson2010; @huebert2011]. Ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) is known to influence dispersal patterns by allowing larvae to be advected by currents of different directions and magnitudes (refer to Chapter 4), and this behavior is therefore included in this model. The values of OVM were taken for the Serranidae larvae sampled within the study region in Chapter 3 (@fig:ovm).

Orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) is known to also influence dispersal patterns (see Chapter 4) and we know that the larvae of most species do not swim aimlessly, instead orientating themselves using sensory cues that are onset with ontogenic development [@leis2010]. While the orientation of *E. daemelii* has not been studied, the ability to orientate in *Epinephelus* has been seen [@arreguin-sanchez1996; @leis2009]. In the model, larvae were given OHS behaviour once postflexion (the development of the caudal fin) was reached. Black cod larvae were given a post-flexion age of 16 days (@tbl:bio-params). The sensory distance, whereby it was assumed a fish could sense settlement habitat through olfactory, auditory cues etc., was 10 km (@tbl:bio-params). Only if a larvae was within this distance and in the postflexion stage was it able to orientate and swim towards the "sensed" habitat. Olfactory lamellae, the lateral line and inner ears fully develop during the period post-flexion to PLD period in a similar species, *Epinephelus fuscoguttatus* [@lim2014]. *E. daemelii* larvae were given a U~crit~ speed of 0.3 ms^-1^ (@tbl:bio-params). The U~crit~ speed was tempered by an *in situ* swimming potential of 16%, using swimming abilities observed in other *Epinephelus* species [@leis2006a]. Larvae were assigned a swimming endurance of 50%, the proportion of each time step they would be able to swim, or one out of every two hours in the model.

### Data analysis

#### Connectivity patterns

The data analysis was performed on the output files of the BDM, which for each modelled year, generates a connectivity matrix, a dispersal kernel and a GIS Shapefile of larval trajectories. The connectivity matrix summarises connectivity between larval source region (row~*i*~) and settlement region (column~*j*~), where each element~*i,j*~ is the proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release period. The dispersal kernel summarises the distribution of larval path distances over the modelled period from source region to settlement region. The GIS Shapefile records the movements through GPS position of individual larvae for each time-step, it was restricted to a subset of of all larvae (5%), chosen randomly due to minimise storage requirements. Patterns of connectivity described by univariate metrics of self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance were also compared amongst regions and years. Settlement richness (the number of regions settled from a source region) and diversity [Shannon-Weiner diversity measure using the richness and number of larvae settled using the R package *vegan*; @oksanen2018] were also measured to describe settlement patterns. One-way ANOVAs with the factor source region (using years as the unit of replication) or year (using source regions as unit of replication) were used to test for significant differences between metrics. Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc tests were used to make comparisons between groups if the ANOVA was significant using the R package *agricolae* [@demendiburu2017].

To address the first aim, evaluating the connectivity patterns over spatial and temporal variation, I compared the connectivity matrices using multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. The connectivity matrix from each year of the model was considered a sampling unit for each of the 19 source regions (source to settlement linkages), with each point on the ordination a representing the settlement from a source region to all settlements regions for a modelled year. The NMDS used a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure with a square root transformation, and the analysis used the function *metaMDS* within the R package *vegan*. To quantitatively compare for spatial and temporal variation between the connectivity matrices, I used the the multivariate analysis PERMANOVA via the *adonis* function within the R package *vegan*, using source regions as replicates. To further investigate the settlement patterns between regions and across years, Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) was performed using the function *capscale* in the R package *vegan*, which allows the use of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures, using the same dissimilarity matrices as above. The univariate metrics described above were also used to investigate both spatial and temporal differences.

To compare the strength of connectivity between regions, heat maps were generated from the connectivity matrices displaying proportional settlement from source region to settlement region, to highlight all connections (not only strong connections) a 4th-root transformation was applied to each element of the matrix. Regions of strong settlement were identified using the coefficient of variation % (CV) for settlement to a region, across the modelled years, for the entire distribution and known areas of aggregation. Strongly interconnected (bi-direction larval exchange) subregions were identified using modularity optimisation (Walktrap method) on a directed graph. Source regions were used as nodes and the edges connecting nodes were weighted by the mean annual settlement between region, using the R package *igraph* [@csardi2006]. Communities are defined by vertexes (regions) having strongly weighted bi-directional edges (settlement) with each other. The Walktrap method uses random walks along the network to identify communities [@pons2006] and is considered accurate for graphs with a small number of vertices [@yang2016a]. Strong connections were defined as having a larval exchange greater than the mean, and a CV for that exchange than was less than the mean across the modelled years. Edges with settlement weights less than the mean, and CV greater than the mean were deleted from the graph were removed. Communities were visualised using dendrograms for clustering and as connected graphs.

The final analysis for the first aim was to compare the known areas of aggregation with the connectivity patterns across the black cod distribution, using the measures of strongly connected areas (heat map and CV) and the univariate metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, dispersal distance, settlement richness and diversity).

#### Marine protected areas

To investigate the second aim, assessing the effectiveness of the MPAs for *E. daemelii* using the modelled connectivity patterns, I compared both strong stable regions of settlement (using the CV of settlement described above) and important spawning regions (high settlement success and local retention) to regions with MPAs. Gaps in protection for protection of important potential spawning or settlement regions were identified using the connectivity matrices from the known regions of aggregation and the entire distribution.

All data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3 (Kite-Eating Tree) and the specified packages above.

Results
-------

Larvae that were released across the entire known distribution, showed dispersal paths that provided settlement across the entire distribution (@fig:trajectories). Larvae that were released along the New South Wales (NSW) coastline tended to disperse close to the coast in the north (apart from the top of NSW), until the middle section of NSW where larvae separated from the coast, and the southern region where larvae appeared to be entrained in mesoscale eddies (identified as particles moving off the coast into swirls; @fig:trajectories A). Connectivity was seen between the New South Wales (NSW) coastline and the offshore reefs; Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs; @fig:trajectories B). Larvae that settled between the offshore islands and NSW coast were observed to dispersed long distances visa currents before reaching an appropriate settlement habitat.

### Investigating the spatial and temporal variation

Comparing the connectivity matrices from source to settlement region between the years 2004-2011, there was a strong latitudinal gradient between source regions (@fig:nmds), depicted by the horseshoe pattern [@podani2002]. The northern regions from the Tweed to the Solitary Islands, exhibit extensive overlap in settlement patterns (@fig:nmds). There is a suggestion of two seperate clusters of settlement pattens, for the regions to the north and south of Port Macquarie. The southern regions along the NSW coast showed lower variation between years than the northern regions, but more dissimilar settlement patterns between regions. Using PERMANOVA, the settlement patterns between years was significantly different (R^2^ = 0.009; p < 0.05), although most of the variation seen was driven by the different source regions (R^2^ = 0.92; p < 0.05). The annual variation in settlement patterns was not consistent between regions. Regions that displayed the highest annual variation in descending order were Lord Howe Island, Port Macquarie, and the Tweed. Eden, Crowdy Bay, and Nambucca appeared to have the lowest annual variability between settlement patterns.

Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used with a square-root transformation (2D stress = 0.12)](chapters/applied/figs/nmds-regions.png){#fig:nmds}

The CAP analysis showed distinct groupings between the settlement patterns of source regions (@fig:cap A). The northern regions (1-5), the central regions (7-11), and the southern regions (12-17) strongly group together. Nambucca is grouped with the offshore reefs—Lord Howe Islands and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs—which has settlement patterns between the northern and central clusters. Comparing the connectivity matrices between years, two broad clusters can be observed, with 2005, 2009, and 2010 grouped together (@fig:cap B). The years 2004 and 2011 were the most similar to each other out of all the connectivity matrices.

There were significant differences in the self-recruitment values between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 52.60, p \< 0.05). Post-hoc tests determined there were seven source regions with the highest values of self-recruitment, with means above 75% (Nambucca, Crowdy Bay, Port Stephens, Wollongong, Ulladulla, Batemans Bay, and Eden; @fig:region-metrics A). The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the Tweed region with 21%. Self-recruitment tended to either be above 65% or below 40%, with one or two exceptions. Local retention was more variable than self-recruitment across most source regions (@fig:region-metrics B), and was different between regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.96, p < 0.05). Local retention was highest in Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Crowdy Bay, and lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs. The settlement success of larvae also varied significantly between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.97, p < 0.05). Settlement success exhibited latitudinal patterns, strongly increasing with latitude from the Tweed until Yamba and then reversing and strongly decreasing with latitude until Port Macquarie (@fig:region-metrics C). Settlement success increased again until the Newcastle and Sydney regions, after which it decreased gradually with latitude. Settlement success was lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs (@fig:region-metrics C). The Tweed, Byron and Port Macquarie regions producing the largest variation of settlement success. Most regions had similar dispersal distances, yet several had significantly longer dispersal distances (F~(18,126)~ = 175.71, p < 0.05). Dispersal distance showed an inverse latitudinal pattern to settlement success, e.g. where settlement success is high, dispersal distance is low (@fig:region-metrics D). Lord Howe Island EM reefs larvae dispersed the longest, with mean distances over 1000km. Of the coastal regions, Eden, Merimbula, and Port Macquarie dispersed the longest.

Settlement richness differed between regions, showing similar patterns to the other connectivity metrics (F~(18,126)~ = 7.12, p < 0.05; @fig:regions-diversity A). The mean number of regions settled ranged from 6.75 at Newcastle, up to 15.25 for EM Reefs. The central source regions of NSW had the lowest richness values. Port Macquarie had the highest richness for the source regions along the coast. Annual variation of settlement richness occurred at all regions, but was larger for the southern and offshore source regions.. The diversity also differed between regions, however, it showed different pattern than richness (F~(18,126)~ = 24.85, p < 0.05; @fig:regions-diversity B), declining from regions the Tweed to Nambucca, and a more random pattern from Port Macquarie to Eden. Diversity was highest at Lord Howe Island, with the next group identified by post-hoc tests being EM Reefs, Tweed, and Byron. The offshore reefs had the largest variation of diversity, suggesting a strong effect of year at these regions, and Port Macquarie had the highest variation amongst the coastal regions. the diversity of settlement patterns from Sydney and Crowdy Bay exhibited the least annual variation.

Crowdy Bay and Sydney had the least variation in self-recruitment between the years 2004-2011, while the source regions of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs), and Newcastle produced the greatest annual variation. There were also significant differences to the self-recruitment between years, averaged across all source regions (F~(7,126)~ = 3.03, p < 0.05; @fig:year-metrics A). Post-hoc tests indicated that in 2011 and 2008 self-recruitment were 10% higher than in 2010. The mean annual self-recruitment values were always above 50%. These two source regions, along with Eden, had the least annual variation in local retention. Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Newcastle had the largest annual variation in the larvae that were locally retained. The mean annual local retention across all regions varied significantly (F~(7,126)~ = 22.214, p < 0.05). The lowest annual local retention values occurred in 2007, which was 53% lower than 2008, the year when the highest local retention transpired (@fig:year-metrics B). In 2007 there was also the least variation of local retention between source regions, while 2008 had the largest variation. There were annual differences in settlement success (F~(7,126)~ = 27.068, p < 0.05), which followed a similar pattern to local retention (@fig:year-metrics B, C). The lowest annual settlement success again occurred in 2007, and the years with most successful settlement were 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 (approximately 1.6 times more likely to settle than 2007 @fig:year-metrics C). There were annual differences between the yearly mean dispersal differences (F~(7,126)~ = 2.70, p < 0.05), however post-hoc tests were unable to identify years that were significantly different to each other (@fig:year-metrics D). The mean dispersal distance per year was about 250 km (@fig:year-metrics D).

Annual variation of settlement richness was found amongst the connectivity patterns (F~(7,126)~ = 5.79, p < 0.05; @fig:years-diversity A). Settlement richness was lowest in the years 2008, 2011, and 2006, and peaked in 2007, however, there was not much variation between years. The settlement diversity was also different between years, but with less variation than the richness (F~(7,126)~ = 3.81, p < 0.05; @fig:years-diversity B). The years of highest diversity were 2010 and 2004, and the lowest were 2005, 2011, 2008 and 2006.

### Identifying areas of strong connectivity

The strongest connectivity for all source regions occurred to geographically close settlement regions, although each source region along the NSW coast showed long tails of connectivity to the south (@fig:heatmap-all). In general, the larvae settled in highest numbers to their natal region, the exceptions being the regions Tweed, Port Macquarie, and Jervis Bay, whereas strong connectivity occurred with the regions directly to the north or south of the source region. Below Newcastle (Sydney to Eden), source regions had more northward settlement, Ulladulla and Merimbula have limited connectivity to Tweed and/or Queensland, but this connectivity was weak and variable. The offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs also mostly recruited to the natal regions and to each other, but also both connected to all regions along the NSW coastline and to Queensland, with the strongest connectivity to regions above Jervis Bay. The connectivity between Lord Howe, EM reefs, and the NSW coastline, while weak, was bi-directional (@fig:heatmap-all). No connectivity was seen to occur to either Norfolk Island or New Zealand from any of the chosen source regions.

Regions are organised latitudinal from north to south with exception of Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs) which are listed last.](chapters/applied/figs//heatmap-all.png){#fig:heatmap-all}

The strongest region of settlement across the time series were Yamba and Solitary Islands, both of which were also the most consistent having the lowest coefficients of variation across the modelled years of any regions in the domain (@fig:cv A). Black cod settlement was highest in the northern-central region of NSW, when considering all source regions. The offshore islands of Lord Howe and EM reefs, along with settlement regions in Queensland and Victoria had the lowest settlement numbers. Queensland, and the most northern NSW region of the Tweed had the highest variation, but for the rest of the regions the annual variation was consistent.

![The coefficient of variation for the mean annual settlement to regions released across the known distribution (A) and from only the known aggregation regions (B).](chapters/applied/figs/settlement-cv.png){#fig:cv}

There are four identified sub-communities that form the network of demographically connected regions from all possible spawning regions when considering the mean annual settlement (@fig:graph-all A). The communities are grouped by latitude and geographic location. The most dissimilar group is the offshore areas Lord Howe Islands and EM Reefs. The next grouping is the south coast, from Ulladulla to Eden. Within this community, Batemans Bay and Merimbula have the most similar settlement patterns. The central community (Port Macquarie to Sydney) and the northern community (Tweed to Nambucca) were more similar to each other than the southern community. Inside the northern community, Tweed and Byron, and Ballina and Yamba were the two grouping of regions that were most similar when comparing the settlement patterns of all regions. Within the central community, Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay had the most similar settlement patterns.

The only strong link between these sub-communities occurred between central and southern communities, at the Sydney and Wollongong regions (@fig:graph-all B). In the northern community each region had strong connectivity with the region latitudinally above or below, except between Byron and Ballina. The northern community was also the only region to have strong connectivity to regions further than this, with strong links between Tweed-Yamba, Byron-Solitary Islands, and Ballina-Solitary Islands. In the central community the strongest linkages were between Pt Macquarie-Crowdy Bay, and Newcastle-Sydney. Crowdy Bay and Port Stephens were not strongly linked, despite the spatial proximity. In the southern community, each regions was linked strongly by latitude, the strongest linkage occurring between Jervis Bay and Ulladulla. Finally in the offshore community, there were neither strong linkages between each other or between other communities.

Only strong connections, considered to be edges with a settlement greater than the mean and coefficient of variation less than the mean were excluded, were shown.](chapters/applied/figs/graph-all.png){#fig:graph-all}

### Connectivity amongst known areas of aggregation

The settlement from the known aggregation regions (Nambucca, Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and EM reefs) was more restricted, with black cod larvae not making it up in Queensland or down into Victoria (@fig:heatmap-known). Three of the source regions, Nambucca, Solitary Islands, and Pt Stephens were the areas of highest settlement and with strong consistency, significantly different from the rest with settlement at Port Stephens was 4.8 times higher than the fourth highest area of settlement (F~(19,133)~ = 140.51, p \< 0.05; @fig:cv B). Yamba and Newcastle were the other regions receiving the highest numbers of new recruits (connectivity was more variable to Yamba), and the south coast had seemingly negligible connectivity (high annual variation). From the five known areas of aggregation, larvae were successfully exported to every region within the domain, suggesting high connectedness.

Using only the known aggregating areas, two clusters were identified; the coastal regions and the off-shore reefs (@fig:graph-known A). The off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs were tightly clustered, suggesting equal flow of larvae between each region. For the coastal regions, Pt Stephens was the out-group to the geographic neighbours, Solitary Islands and Nambucca. Within the coastal population, the strong linkage occurred from Solitary Islands to Nambucca, and the off-shore population had a strong connection from EM Reef region to Lord Howe Island (@fig:graph-known B).

Edge thickness is proportional to number of settlers and only strong connections were shown, considered to be edges with a settlement greater than the mean and coefficient of variation less than the mean were excluded.](chapters/applied/figs/graph-known.png){#fig:graph-known}

Considering only the known areas of aggregation, Solitary Islands produced the most successfully settling larva, mostly through local retention (@fig:region-metrics B), but also to Nambucca, the region below (@fig:heatmap-known). This high local-retention was reflected by the low dispersal distance for larvae from the Solitary Islands (@fig:region-metrics D). However, it is also the most important source region for itself, with annual self-recruitment values of 72.9 ± 7.7 (@fig:region-metrics A). The other known aggregation regions on the NSW coast of Port Stephens and Nambucca also both have high self-recruitment at about 80% (@fig:region-metrics A). The settlement at Nambucca showed slightly less annual variability than either the Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens (@fig:cv B), but the differences were small. Pt Stephens showed strongest connectivity to the Sydney and Wollongong regions, but had some of the lowest overall settlement success (and highly variable) for the NSW regions (@fig:region-metrics C). Compared to Solitary Islands and Nambucca, larvae spawned from Port Stephens showed the strongest connections to the southern regions of NSW, dispersing with a mean distance of 112.2 km before settlement (@fig:region-metrics D).

Even though Lord Howe Island and EM reefs both support populations of black cod, these regions had the lowest settlement success in the model (@fig:region-metrics C). Both had low local retention and highly variable but self-recruitment above 25% (@fig:region-metrics A; @fig:region-metrics B). Larvae spawned at Lord Howe Island larvae settled consistently to all regions in NSW, apart from Yamba to Nambucca. EM reefs showed similar settlement patterns to Lord Howe, except the larvae spawned at EM reefs had limited connectivity to the most northern regions Tweed, Byron, and Ballina (@fig:heatmap-known). The larvae from these regions were also the most dispersed, travelling on average more than 1000 km before successfully settling (@fig:region-metrics D).

### Marine Park Connectivity

The total marine protected area (MPA) within the modelled domain is 3297.5 km^2^ (the total NSW marine estate is in excess of 10,000 km^2^; http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), of which 702 km^2^ (21.6%) are designated as sanctuary zones (providing protection from all fishing activity, i.e. commercial and recreational; @tbl:mpas). However, permits can be obtained to fish in a few of these zones, specifically MPAs managed by the Commonwealth of Australia, and several of the sanctuary zones have policing amnesties while marine policy is still being considered. Eleven of the source regions (58%) contained a marine protected area. The most coverage by area occurred in the Port Stephens region, with 980 km^2^ and the least coverage was 0.78 km^2^ within the Tweed region (@tbl:mpas). The EM Reefs had the most comprehensive coverage, as the entire region falls within a MPA. The Sydney region has the most MPAs within its boundaries (10), but the total extent of the coverage is only 19 km^2^ of protected area, of which 6 km^2^ (32%) is classified as sanctuary zones. It must also be noted all of the sanctuary zones do not contain suitable habitat for *E. daemelii*, i.e. sandy beaches with no rocky reef.

PAGEBREAKLANDSCAPE

Of the four sub-communities identified, each community had at least one source region that contained an MPA (@fig:graph-all A; @tbl:mpas). The offshore community of Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs had the most protection afforded to any of the communities per region, with both regions encompassed by MPAs (EM Reefs has 100% coverage), and containing 58% sanctuary zones at EM Reefs (Middleton Reef) and 27.0% sanctuary zones at Lord Howe Island covering 175 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). In the northern community, three of the six regions contained MPAs (Tweed, Byron, and Solitary Islands), although the aquatic reserve in Tweed is one of the smallest MPAs in size. The total MPA coverage within this northern community is 941 km^2^, of which 148 km^2^ (15.7%). The central community also contained three regions with MPAs (Port Macquarie, Port Stephens, and Sydney), with a total coverage of 1003 km^2^ (20.5% or 206 km^2^ falls within sanctuary zones). In the southern community, half the regions contained MPAs (Wollongong, Jervis Bay, and Batemans Bay), with 1065 km^2^ coverage, 19.2% (205 km^2^) of the MPAs were sanctuary zoned.

Considering all source regions, regions with the highest self-recruitment (>75%), only 37.5% contained MPAs: Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, and Batemans Bay (@fig:region-metrics A). The MPAs within these three regions have sanctuary zone coverage greater than 80 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). For regions with MPAs, several had significantly lower local retention than other regions (Lord Howe Island, EM Reefs, Tweed, Pt Macquarie, Byron, and Jervis Bay), while out of the region with the two groups with the highest local retention five (Solitary Islands, Batemans Bay, Port Stephens, Sydney, Wollongong) of the ten regions have MPAs (@fig:region-metrics B). Only two of the five regions with the highest successful settlement have MPAs within the boundaries, Solitary Islands and Sydney (@fig:region-metrics C). While the Solitary Islands has 86 km^2^ of sanctuary zones within the Solitary Islands Marine Reserve, Sydney with 10 aquatic reserves only has 6 km^2^. For the known areas of aggregation, only Nambucca does not contain a MPA. The four regions that do have MPAs comprise of 62.3% of total sanctuary zoned area across the entire model domain (@tbl:mpas). Of the four, Solitary Islands has the least amount of sanctuary zone compared to total area, at 86 km^2^.

For *E. daemelii* larvae released from all source regions, of the six regions with the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands, Sydney, and Wollongong have MPAs (@fig:cv A). It should be noted that Sydney and Wollongong only have MPAs with coverage of 19 km^2^ and 0.4 km^2^ respectively (@tbl:mpas). Yamba, the region with the most consistent settlement, contains no MPAs. When considering only areas of known aggregation, of the three regions with the the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens have large MPAs (@fig:cv A; @tbl:mpas)

### Spatial patterns of connectivity

A biophysical connectivity model was used to investigate the connectivity patterns of the *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae along the eastern coast of Australia. The connectivity patterns strongly differed amongst the 19 source regions and between the years of release. The spatial variation, accounting for most of the differences in settlement patterns between regions, exhibited a strong latitudinal gradient as seen by the horseshoe effect. The reason for this latitudinal gradient is that the ocean circulation off the New South Wales (NSW) coast is heterogenous and has a poleward direction, i.e. towards lower latitudes. The narrow continental shelf subjects larvae to the boundary current, the East Australia Current (EAC). The EAC moves along the coast from northern NSW to about 30.7°S - 32.4°S, where it splits off from the coast of NSW in a region termed the separation zone [@cetina-heredia2014]. The water mass that does not split off here is further carried down the coast, dispersing larvae poleward. The connectivity matrices show that the direction is not only downwards, counter currents which flow north also allow for the upwards transport seen between regions [@coleman2011]. The northern regions (1-5), appear to have restricted dispersal by the close proximation of the EAC, having similar settlement patterns, dispersing strongly in the direction of the EAC. In this study, the source regions Nambucca (the southern end), Port Macquarie, and Crowdy Bay (the northern end) occur contain this separation zone region (@fig:release-regions). The phenomena is most distinct at the region Port Macquarie, showing this separation zone lowers the metrics of settlement success, local retention, self-recruitment, and increases the dispersal distance as larvae are dispersed away from the coast by the EAC. The separation of the EAC also markedly increases the settlement richness and diversity from a source region. The location of the separation zone changes in time, explaining the high variation in settlement patterns and metrics often seen at Pt Macquarie.

An unexpected result for ichthyoplankton larvae with such a long pelagic larval duration (30-50 days), were the high self-recruitment values seen across regions, often greater than 50%. While in small areas, self-recruitment of coral reef fish have been shown to have similar small scale levels of dispersion [@berumen2012a; @swearer1999a], the EAC was predicted to settle particles at more southerly regions, lowering self-recruitment. The size of the regions (~125km) explain the relatively high self-recruitment (and local retention) values seen. The self-recruitment and local retention values seen in our model were higher than seen for a similar modelled species (*Epinephelus marginatus*) in the Mediterranean [@andrello2013], caveating that the settlement regions were of varying sizes and most likely smaller than source regions in this study.

Local retention was considerably higher on the coast than at the off-shore reefs, again this can be explained by currents due to larvae at off-shore reefs being able to disperse in more directions. the variation in local retention can only be explained by the heterogenous currents along the coast. Areas without eddies and near-shore boundary currents had the highest local retention, however high local retention still occurred in southern NSW where mesoscale eddies often entrained the larvae. Areas of higher self-recruitment tended to be areas of higher local retention. This suggests larval immigration to coastal regions was consistent across regions, so when local retention increased, the percentage of immigrants decreased, and this self-recruitment increased. Only Eden did not fit this trend, however is was the most southern region on the coastline, and therefore could only accept immigrants from regions above. The reason for the strong gradient of settlement success is also suggest to be regional hydrodynamics, as settlement success was almost the inverse of dispersal distance. Suggesting the less black cod larvae disperse the better off they are. Settlement richness exhibited the same pattern as dispersal distance, as expected results, as the further larvae disperse the more regions that can be settled. Settlement diversity showed a strong latitudinal gradient along the regions (1-6), suggesting that the further EAC goes along the coast, the more homogenous the regions of settlement become (reflected in the self-recruitment metrics). Becoming more diverse at the separation zone and the bumping around for the rest.

### Temporal patterns of connectivity

Over the eight modelled years, there was annual variation in the settlement patterns of the modelled *E. daemelii* larvae, even considering variation was small compared to the spatial variation. Of the eight modelled years, 2004 and 2011 had the most similar settlement patterns. The annual variation underscores the heterogeneity of the currents both spatially and temporally. This annual variation is settlement patterns might not have much effect on k-selected species such as *E. daemelii*, for long lived species, demographics are not effect by isolated years of low settlement might not have much effect on demographics and promotes gene flow between regions as settlement richness increases.

The years 2004 and 2007 were the most dissimilar compared to the other modelled years in terms of connectivity metrics, in which black cod larvae had less local retention, lower settlement success, and dispersed further. This increased dispersal resulted in higher settlement richness and settlement diversity. The EAC is known for both its annual variation along decadal cycles and southward shift [@ridgway2007], and combined with the natural variation in wind patterns driving surface currents, serves as a possible explanation. In addition, there is variability in the timing of formation, size, and rotation speed of mesoscale eddies off the south-east Australian coast, especially in the region names 'Eddy Avenue' between 32°S and 39°S [@everett2012]. Increased entrainment in large mesoscale eddies could explain these findings. Interestingly, while the connectivity patterns seen in 2011 were considered similar to 2004, this was not reflected in the metrics.

Other studies have seen variations in connectivity with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events La Nina and El Nino [@treml2008; @roughan2011], however, in this study the annual variation seen cannot be easily explained by these climatic patterns. The ENSO events that transpired during the modelling period (April-July) were a weak 2006 and moderate 2009 El Nino event, and a moderate 2007 and strong 2010 La Nina event [@bureauofmeteorology2018]. For the out-grouping of settlement patterns (2005, 2009, 2010; @fig:cap), only two of the three years had ENSO events. The other grouping also contained two years with ENSO events, suggesting it was not the key driver of the annual variation seen in settlement patterns. Neither did the patterns in the connectivity or settlement metrics show strong affinity with ENSO events. One explanation for these differences could be larval biology; ontogenetic vertical migration and orientated horizontal swimming larvae were given in this study, compared to the passive larvae advected by horizontal and vertical currents only in the mentioned study. Perhaps vertical and horizontal movement gave the larvae the ability to overcome ENSO conditions. Another explanation could be the shortened window of dispersal (majority of the larval dispersal occurring between April and July), where ESNO conditions are most prevalent in the summer and winter months.

### Strength of connections

The strongest pathways of settlement for *E. daemelii* larvae were either within the natal region or to the regions in direct geographical proximity (either latitudinally above or below). Strong settlement for some coastal regions also showed poleward tails, showing strong settlement to more than one region of decreasing latitude. Similar patterns of modelled connectivity for fish larvae with similar PLDs along the NSW coast have been observed, even though this study did not explicitly model any vertical or horizontal movement behaviour [@roughan2011]. The model included mortality, and these patterns are consistent with the knowledge that probability of survival for reef fish larvae decreases with dispersal distance [@buston2012]. This local settlement phenomena is emphasised by the regions with the strongest and most consistent settlement (Yamba, Solitary Islands, Crowdy Bay, Ulladulla, Sydney, and Wollongong), also had relatively high local retention and self-recruitment.

Releasing black cod larvae across their known distribution identified four sub-communities (northern, central, and southern coastal communities, the an offshore reefs community). The strong effect of the poleward EAC can be seen in the northern community, the only community with strong connections to regions that are not nearest neighbours. The northern and central communities appear to be disconnected by the separation zone of the EAC and the coast. The reason for the disconnect between the central and southern communities between Sydney and Wollongong is unclear, as there is a strong connection between the region, the only strong cross-community connection. The coastal communities were seemingly closed systems with higher local retention and high self-recruitment, and the offshore islands were open systems, with low local retention combined with low self-recruitment. There are potential genetic connections across all of the sub-communities, including between the offshore islands and the NSW coastline, as previously hypothesised [@appleyard2007]. Within the offshore islands, interestingly, no strong connections were seen between the two regions, suggesting the settlement is lower than what occurs at the coastal regions. Although there are regions that are not strongly connected within the communities e.g. Crowdy Bay and Port Stephens or Merimbula and Eden. The reason for this "weak" (as opposed to strong) connectivity between neighbouring regions is assumed to be regional hydrodynamics.

### Comparisons with known spawning areas

As expected, regions with high local retention, self-recruitment and strong settlement when releasing larvae across the known distribution, also exhibited these traits when only considering the regions with known aggregations, i.e. Solitary Islands, Nambucca, and Port Stephens. As the coastal regions occur in northern to central NSW, the main difference compared to the releasing across the known distribution was the low connectivity to the southern region. The two most southern regions, Merimbula and Eden had the lowest connectivity, seemingly the limit of the black cod range from the known aggregating regions as there was no connectivity to Victoria. Not surprisingly, the three coastal sites formed a community, and the offshore islands formed a community (similar to what was seen for the entire distribution). Although settlement from the three costal sites did demonstrate connectivity to the majority of regions, only the offshore reefs connected to Queensland or the Tweed. The low connectivity to most regions, while not providing stable demographic connectivity, does provide gene flow, something that has been seen in other reef fish along the NSW coast [@curley2009]. This potential gene flow is especially important for the genetic diversity of the populations that occur in the offshore reefs. Although, the life history of *E. daemelii*, suggests that other factors such as migration drive genetic connectivity along the NSW coast.

Surveys of juvenile *E. daemelii* have found abundance peaks in rock pools at and below Port Stephens on the NSW coast, with only one juvenile found at northern sites where adult abundance is high [@harasti2014a]. The connectivity patterns from the model for known aggregations suggest that along with Port Stephens, the northern regions of Solitary Islands and Nambucca should also be areas of strong settlement. The surveys also found juvenile *E. daemelii* in the Sydney, Ulladulla and Jervis Bay regions, all of which the model suggested had low settlement from the known areas of aggregation and in the case of Ulladulla, one of the highest annual variations amongst the settlement regions. Reasons for not seeing larvae in the northern regions could be due to post-settlement process, such as high mortality from predation [@almany2006] or interspecific competition [@mccormick2012]. Although the larvae in the northern region could also be using other sub-tidal habitats not considered in the context of the survey. It also suggests the potential of unknown aggregations along the NSW coast, juveniles in Sydney are predicted to come from the Sydney or Newcastle regions, juveniles in Ulladulla are predicted to come from Ulladulla, Jervis Bay or Batemans Bay, and juveniles in Jervis Bay are predicted to come from Jervis Bay or Wollongong.

### Overlap of predicted connectivity patterns with current marine protected areas

Marine protected areas (especially sanctuary zones) have been shown to be effective in increase Serranidae abundance [@hackradt2014; @chiappone2000]. The high connectivity, either to the natal region, or the regions in close proximity, suggests that marine protected areas (MPAs) should be located at areas of high local retention (population persistence), high self-recruitment (the population relies heavily on itself), and strong settlement (high recruits and low CV). The life-history of *E. daemelii* suggest that larvae that settle within a region might not necessarily remain as adults within that region due to hypothesised northward migrations along the coast [@francis2016], there is still a requirement to maintain essential settlement habitat for larvae for populations to persist.

Of the five regions that contain known aggregations, only the Nambucca region does not contain a MPA, and all of these MPAs have sanctuary zone area greater than 50 km^2^. As long as these sanctuary zones contain suitable black cod habitat, reasonable protection for spawning aggregations should be present, noting that the sizes of the sanctuary vary considerably across the MPAs. The offshore community is the most protected, with seemingly all the available adult black cod habitat under MPA protection, and a considerable amount (excluding Elizabeth Reef) of this protection is designated as sanctuary zones. For the coastal sites, the Solitary Islands region is the best protected, containing high functionality for black cod with high local retention, high self-recruitment and strong settlement. Although only 12% of the Solitary Islands Marine Park is designated as sanctuary zones, the lowest of the established marine parks.

Comparing the connectivity across the known distribution, within the four sub-communities identified (northern, central, southern, and offshore), each have sizeable MPA coverage within their confines. Although, apart from the offshore reef regions that has protection 100% of the regions, the MPAs are located in less than 50% of the regions within each community. The k-selected *E. daemelii* means that population recovery can take a decade or more, and is susceptible to even low level fishing pressure [@abesamis2014]. Even though many of these parks have been in place since 2002, in over a decade no clear signs of population recovery have been seen [@francis2016]. This suggests that perhaps the current network of protected areas is not sufficient to aid the population recovery of *E. daemelii*. The network of marine reserves in NSW have been shown to provide strong connectivity for some species, but not others [@coleman2011].

### Potential regions of connectivity to include protection

Of the known aggregating regions, only Nambucca did not contain a MPA. Given the region has high self-recruitment and local retention, it has potential as a highly functional MPA. Habitat protection of intertidal rocky shores and sub-tidal rocky reefs within Nambucca would also provide protection of essential habitat for settlement stage larvae arriving from the strongly connected Solitary Islands region. In addition, black cod larvae spawned within the Nambucca region also show strong settlement to the Solitary Islands region, emphasising the strong connectivity between the two areas. The other area additional marine protection could be investigated is habitat protection of settlement habitats of the Pt Stephens region, where apart from Pt Stephens, the larvae settle predominately to Newcastle and Sydney. These two regions have little formal habitat protection when considering the area covered, and the high populations put development pressure on coastal areas. These are also regions where juvenile *E. daemelii* have been found [@harasti2014a], strengthening the case for habitat protection.

Considering the entire distribution, the regions Yamba and Ballina within the northern community are strongly connected to other regions, while also displaying high local retention, making them good candidates for having MPAs within their boundaries. The northern part of the state is where *E. daemelii* is most abundant and therefore should produce the largest spawning events [@harasti2013]. The central area has the least protection, with sites of high settlement success (Newcastle, Sydney, and Wollongong), a key consideration when designing MPAs. The Sydney region was also known historically to have abundant black cod populations [@francis2016]. While currently adult populations are found mostly in the north of NSW, warming oceans is pushing temperate species further south [@verges2014], and therefore considering more protected areas in the southern community will be a priority, with the most obvious candidate Ulladulla, with high local retention, settlement success and strong connectivity.

Marine protected areas, specifically sanctuary zones, are not a panacea to population recovery, but one of the Management tools available. Within the most protected community, the offshore reefs, population densities of *E. daemelii* have still be seen to decrease [@pratchett2011]. Also the protected area must contain suitable habitat, for adult spawning populations and larval settlement within the protected areas to be effective, something that was not taken into account in our analysis. To increase the spawning output of *E. daemelii*, reducing fishing pressure is a key component, to both allow *E. daemelii* to reach reproductive age (~25 years), and to be able to aggregate in sufficient numbers to spawn. Therefore sanctuary areas, within their known distribution of *E. daemelii*, are an important tool to assist in maximising the spawning output.

### Limitations and future directions.

The most notable limitation of this modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

Conclusion
----------

In summary, my results suggest for *E. daemelii* larvae spawned from their known distribution there are strong spatial differences in settlement patterns, influenced by a latitudinal gradient. The EAC has a strong influence moving larvae southwards, but cross currents and mesoscale eddies also provide some northern connectivity. There is also annual variation, in general, different settlement patterns are predicted each year, driven by changes in hydrodynamics. Four communities of connectivity were identified; northern, central and southern coastal communities, and another community containing the offshore reefs. The settlement from each region along the coast was mostly local retention to the natal region, or the regions above and below. Connectivity was predicted between all coastal regions and the offshore reefs. No connectivity was seen to Norfolk Island or NZ. The northern regions had long downwards tails and the southern regions settled further north. Connectivity from the areas with known populations produced two communities, a coastal community and an offshore community, and the highest settlement was to the regions with the known populations. Each of these identified communities, from the known distribution or populations, contained marine protected areas, but there are key regions for *E. daemelii* that could be protected, i.e. Nambucca from the known populations, and more protection in the northern and central communities when considering the known distribution. After 35 years of protection, *E. daemelii* still remains vulnerable with no clear signs of population recovery, suggesting more management options should be considered.
