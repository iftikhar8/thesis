# Estimating the larval dispersal of black cod *Epinephelus daemelii* across is distribution along the eastern coast of Australia and potential implications for its conservation management


## Abstract

The black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) is a large, long-lived reef fish of the family Serranidae, and found mostly along the New South Wales (NSW) coastline. [Minor 2502]{.comment-start id="2502" author="Reviewer 2"}Population declines from fishing pressure throughout the 20th century warranted the listing *E. daemelii* as a threatened species in 1983.[]{.comment-end id="2502"} Within the distribution of *E. daemelii*, there is a network of marine protected areas (MPAs; both NSW and Commonwealth) established since 2007 (with no-take zones of varying sizes). Despite most known *E. daemelii* populations occurring inside these MPAs, this protection has not resulted in population recovery. One explanation is that the MPA network does not meet its objectives for *E. daemelii*. This chapter aimed to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii* along its known distribution using a biophysical dispersal model, identifying potential strong spawning regions and regions of strong settlement, and comparing this possible connectivity with the MPA network. *E. daemelii* larvae were released during April-May (2004-2011) from 19 known regions across its distribution and tracked until settlement (both reefs and rocky intertidal shores). The results predicted high local retention and self-recruitment for Solitary Islands, Nambucca and Port Stephens, suggesting sustaining these populations is critical to the persistence of populations in these regions. *E. daemelii* connectivity was predicted to occur between the offshore populations (Elizabeth and Middleton reefs) and the NSW coast, suggesting genetic, if not demographic, connectivity exists. The model identified four strongly connected communities of *E. daemelii* across the distribution. [Minor 2501]{.comment-start id="2501" author="Reviewer 2"}While each community contained marine protected areas (and no-take areas), regions within a community that were predicted to have strong settlement success, high local retention and strong  settlement could benefit from additional protection.[]{.comment-end id="2501"} Further research is required to determine if *E. daemelii* dispersal can be predicted by the model, noting that post-settlement processes were not considered. This study provides predictions of dispersal for *E. daemelii* across the NSW coast and offshore regions, which can be used as part of a suite of tools for conservation managers to aid in its recovery.


## Introduction

In marine systems, spatially discrete populations can be connected to each other through larval exchange. This connectivity (exchange of individuals between populations) provides both demographic and genetic functionality and is fundamental to the viability of marine populations. [Minor 2503]{.comment-start id="2503" author="Reviewer 2"}Metapopulation dynamics can arise from spatially connected independent populations[]{.comment-end id="2503"} and the volatility of the dispersal connecting these populations can have important ecological and evolutionary repercussions [@hanski1998; @sale2006a]. Connectivity variation drives metapopulation dynamics, i.e. the number of individuals exchanged, the direction of the exchange, and the distance of dispersal [@figueira2009].

[Minor 2504]{.comment-start id="2504" author="Reviewer 2"}For marine species, including many reef fish species, this connectivity often occurs primarily during a pelagic larval stage [@sale1991]. Reef fish often have sedentary adult phases, and therefore any connectivity between populations occurs only during this period when the larvae are pelagic [@cowen2007][]{.comment-end id="2504"} . Recent empirical understanding has identified that larval dispersal is not merely passive advection by ocean currents and turbulent systems, instead it is complex, driven by a combination of physical and biological processes [@cowen2009; @paris2007; @leis2007]. Larval development allows for larvae to influence their dispersal through behaviours such as vertical migration [@paris2004; @irisson2010] and sensory abilities which larvae can use [Minor 3501]{.comment-start id="3501" author="Reviewer 3"}to orientate and swim, including towards[]{.comment-end id="3501"} settlement sites [@faillettaz2015; @berenshtein2014]. Measuring this connectivity is difficult using empirical methods, which have spatial and temporal limitations. Instead, biophysical dispersal modelling is a useful tool to estimate connectivity using oceanographical models coupled with biological models, which enable prediction of connectivity over large spatial and temporal scales [@roberts2010; @paris2013; @kool2015].

Connectivity is often overlooked when designing marine protected areas (MPAs) in favour of protecting habitat [@crowder2006]. Global change in the time of the Anthropocene makes designing well connected MPAs an important problem for ensuring the resilience of marine metapopulations from threats such climate change, overfishing and diseases [@almany2009; @botsford2009]. Well-connected MPA networks can satisfy the objectives of both conservation and fisheries management [@gaines2010; @christie2010]. Understanding and measuring connectivity within a marine metapopulation is necessary to design effective networks MPAs, with optimal locations, size, and spacing [@anadon2013].

Black cod, *Epinephelus daemelii* (Gunther, 1876), also known commonly as the black rockcod, the saddled rockcod, and the potted black grouper, are large groupers of the teleost family Serranidae. *E. daemelii* is native to Australia and New Zealand in the south-western Pacific Ocean. Its known distribution ranges from eastern Australia (southern Queensland down to Bass Strait) to Northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, with populations on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs [@froese2017; @atlasoflivingaustralia2018]. Along eastern Australia, *E. daemelii* is primarily distributed along the temperate waters of the New South Wales (NSW) coastline.
*E. daemelii* can reach the age of 65 years, grow to 170 cm total length (TL) and weigh 80 kg [@francis2016]. Like many large groupers, it is a protogynous hermaphrodite, with protogyny not occurring until the adult fish reaches lengths of over 100 cm (TL), which occurs at ~25 years [@francis2016]. Anecdotally, black cod are thought to breed April-May, as this is when aggregations have been seen on the north coast of NSW (D. Harasti, personal communication, 9 March 2017). *E. daemelii* spawn pelagic eggs with the pelagic larval stage estimated to last 60 days as they transition to the juvenile ontogenetic stage for settlement [@francis2016]. The post-settlement juveniles of black cod are found in rock pools and shallow reef intertidal habitats, migrating to estuaries as they grow older and as adults they live in the caves and crevices found on rocky reefs at depths of up to 50 m [@harasti2014; @francis2016].

*E. daemelii* has traditionally been under fishing pressure in Australia, it is considered a trophy fish for spearfishers and as targeted species for its palatable taste by commercial and recreational fishers [it was commonly sold at the Sydney fish markets; @francis2016]. *E. daemelii* is a *K* strategeist with a long life-span, large body size, low mortality rate and late sexual maturity [@adams1980], and combined with other traits such as aggregate spawning (anecdotally), specific habitat requirements, and a sedentary/curious nature, all increase the vulnerability of *E. daemelii* to fishing. Population declines for the black cod have been recorded since 1916 and in 1983, due to dwindling numbers, it was eventually listed for protection in NSW [@francis2016]. The protection listing was driven by notable population declines coinciding with the rise in popularity of spearfishing in the late 1960s and 1970s [@pogonoski2002; @young2015]. Black cod is currently listed as "Near Threatened" on the ICUN red list [@pollard2018] and listed as "Vulnerable" under the Australian Commonwealth *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act* since 2006 [@departmentoftheenvironment2018].

The predominent threat to the *E. daemelii* population comes from hook and line fishing, other substantial threats come from climate change and water pollution [@nswdpi2012]. The total ban on fishing *E. daemelii* since 1983 results in by-catch (or unintended catch) and illegal fishing being the primary threats to population recovery. Protecting *E. daemelii* involves both safeguarding known (and potential) areas of aggregation of mature sexually active *E. daemelii* adults from fishing pressure to maximise the reproductive output of spawning populations and habitat protection for the intertidal rocky reef and estuarine habitats it uses throughout its lifecycle [@harasti2013]. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a management tool that can assist in the population recovery of *E. daemelii* by achieving both of these priorities of protection with no-take (sanctuary) zones. However, no-take zones are not a panacea for *K* strategists such as the black cod, population recovery is a slow process and these populations are sensitive to low levels of fishing mortality even within no-take reserves [@abesamis2016; @friedlander2002]. Therefore, the current NSW recovery plan for *E. daemelii* has established a long-term goal (20 years) to de-list it as a vulnerable species [@nswdpi2012].

*E. daemelii* exist in populations of various sizes within the NSW marine parks (i.e. MPAs) and a few of the aquatic reserves, along with two of the Commonwealth marine reserves [Cod Grounds and Lord Howe Island Marine Reserve; @pogonoski2002], potentially providing adequate protection. For MPAs to be effective for a species, there must be connectivity between the protected areas [Minor 2505]{.comment-start id="2505" author="Reviewer 2"}and/or[]{.comment-end id="2505"} strong local retention within the protected areas [@botsford2001; @botsford2009], and adequate protection of high-quality habitat, [Minor 2506]{.comment-start id="2506" author="Reviewer 2"}e.g. carrying capacity[]{.comment-end id="2506"} [@cabral2016]. MPAs have been seen to be effective in increasing Serranidae populations [@hackradt2014; @chiappone2000]. Protecting high-quality habitat is also important for maintaining reef soundscapes used by ichthyoplankton to orientate and settle [@gordon2018]. The current network of marine parks in NSW, while spatially distributed, has been shown to provide strong connectivity for some species, but not others [@coleman2011]. [Minor 1502]{.comment-start id="1502" author="Reviewer 1"}Therefore, even though many of these parks have been in place since 2002 and it has been protected since 1983 from recreational and commercial fisheries [@georgeson2014], no noticable signs of population recovery have been seen for *E. daemelii* [@francis2016] and it is still not found to reside in many habitats where it was known to occur in prolific numbers [@harasti2013]. However, marine protected areas, specifically no-take zones, are not a panacea to population recovery. *E. daemelii* population densities within the protected offshore reef regions have been seen to decrease [@pratchett2011]. One potential explanation for this lack of improvement is that the current MPA network is not optimal for *E. daemelii*. Unfortunately, there is currently little information on the connectivity and recruitment dynamics of *E. daemelii* [@francis2016] against which to assess the adequacy of protection measures.[]{.comment-end id="1502"}

[Major 2501]{.comment-start id="2501" author="Reviewer 2"}The first aim of this chapter is to investigate the spatiotemporal differences in predicted dispersal patterns of *E. daemelii* using a biophysical dispersal model. To investigate temporal variation and increasing the predictive power [@wiens1989], the biophysical dispersal model was run using eight years (2004-2011) of hydrodynamic data.[]{.comment-end id="2501"} The aim was broken down into three parts (1) to identify differences in potential dispersal considering the two different spatial contexts, (2) identifying potential sub-populations defined by strong and stable dispersal between regions, and (3) comparing predicted dispersal pattrns from releasing larvae across its known distribution and releasing larvae from only regions known spawning aggregations. The second aim is to understand how the current network of MPAs, both Commonwealth and NSW, align with areas of high settlement, local retention and spawning success from the estimated dispersal patterns. Modelled dispersal patterns, derived from both known aggregations as well as the entire known distribution, can assist conservation management decisions in aiding the recovery of the *E. daemelii* population.


## Methods

### Study location

The model domain covered the known distribution of *E. daemelii* [@francis2016]; the eastern coast of Australia and the offshore reefs: Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (@fig:release-regions). The coastal region of New South Wales (NSW) consists of a narrow continental shelf, with a boundary current, the East Australian Current (EAC), which strongly influences dispersal in the region with its poleward direction and by the mesoscales eddies it generates [@suthers2011]. The study area was divided into 19 spawning regions (see Chapter 4 methods for more detail), 17 approximately equally sized regions (~125 km of coastline) along the NSW coast, and two off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs. Within each region, areas of approximately equally sized sections of contiguous reef were demarcated as specific reef patches. In total there were 560 reef patches in the model domain with about ~25 reef patches per region, except the offshore areas which were considered one continuous reef (as per Chapter 3). Elizabeth and Middleton reefs were considered one region due to local proximity and strong local demographic connectivity, and are thought to be a single stock [@vanherwerden2009]. *E. daemelii* were allowed to settle to other areas within their known distribution that were not used as spawning sites due to their distance from the eastern coast of Australia, the small size of their populations, or where they are considered to be non-breeding, i.e. Queensland, Victoria, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand [@francis2016]. While all specific areas of spawning are not known, the most abundant known populations within the model domain occur at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca (Fish Rock), Port Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton reefs [@harasti2013].

![Location of rocky reef patches used for spawning *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae in each of the 19 regions along the coastline of New South Wales, Australia and the offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth reef and Middleton reef (EM Reefs)](chapters/applied/figs/release-sites.png){#fig:release-regions}

Within the model domain, I identified 20 marine protected areas that were relevant to *E. daemelii* habitat (ignoring most protected areas in Commonwealth waters more than three nautical miles from the coast of Australia as they do not contain adult or juvenile habitat for *E. daemelii* and fishing pressure on larval fish is considered to be negligible). The MPAs fall under two jurisdictions: the NSW Government (18 MPAs) and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (2 MPAs). The 18 NSW MPAs consist of six marine parks known to occur within the modelled domain (Cape Byron Marine Park, Solitary Islands Marine Park, Lord Howe Island Marine Park, Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Jervis Bay Marine Park, and Batemans Marine Park) and 12 aquatic reserves (@fig:nsw-mpas). In addition, two Commonwealth MPAs which are located within the model domain were considered: Lord Howe Commonwealth Marine Reserve (which contains Elizabeth and Middleton reefs), and Cod Grounds Commonwealth Marine Reserve (@fig:commonwealth-mpas). Information on the size of the MPA and no-take zone areas of current marines parks was sourced from the NSW Government (http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/marine). The NSW MPAs have four levels of protection: no-take zones (no-take areas), habitat protection zones (recreational fishing and some commercial fishing allowed), general use zones (recreational and commercial fishing permitted), and special protection zones (reserved for traditional Aboriginal use). For the two Commonwealth MPAs of interest, recreational and commercial fishing is only authorised by permit, and commercial fishing permits do not extend within two nautical miles of Elizabeth Reef. While protecting both spawning aggregations through reduced fishing pressure, and maintaining critical habitats for adults and juvenile populations are key management priorities, in this analysis, I have not assessed MPAs for the amount of critical *E. daemelii* habitat that falls within the protection zones.

### The biophysical model

Connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii* were estimated using the ZISSOU biophysical dispersal model [BDM; v1.1.3; @hawes2018]; see the methods in Chapter 4 for a complete description (see Appendix C for configuration files). ZISSOU is an individual-based model, moving larvae within the system using a coupled biological-physical model. Larvae are advected within the model domain using the output from a hydrodynamic model and turbulent processes. The biological model applies traits (i.e. pelagic larval duration, developmental rates) and behaviours (i.e. ontogenetic vertical migration, orientated horizontal swimming) that influence the dispersal. If an individual larva reaches suitable habitat before the end of the pelagic larval duration it settles, and no post-settlement processes are considered.

The physical model was forced with hydrodynamic flow data from BRAN3 [Bluelink reanalysis, version 3p5; @oke2013], a data-assimilating hindcast model which resolves mesoscale eddies with mean daily velocities. BRAN3 has a resolution of 0.1° latitude and longitude and resolves depth velocities at bins of 5-10 m. As with similar studies [@condie2016; @chiswell2011], an eddy diffusivity value (K) of 300 ms^-1^ was implemented in the model. Larvae positions in the BDM were updated based on a time step of two hours.

The biological model was parametrised with values obtained from the literature for the species *E. daemelii* where possible. In the cases where values could not be sourced for a particular parameter, values for similar species or averages across species within the genus were used instead. If this was not possible, then general values from the review in Chapter 2 were utilised (@tbl:blackcod-params). [Minor 3502]{.comment-start id="3502" author="Reviewer 3"} Noting that some of the values were taken from studies on *Epinephelus* larvae reared in mesocosms [@cunha2013], which can have longer developmental times than wild fish [@miller2009].[]{.comment-end id="3502"}

Larvae were released from four reef patches per region daily (chosen ad hoc, unless specific reef patches were known to contain sightings of *E. daemelii*), during the hypothesised spawning months April-May, over eight years (2004-2011). For each reef patch, 4000 pelagic eggs were spawned per day (16,000 per region) over the 61-day period. In total, 18.5 million eggs were released each breeding season and 148 million over the course of the experiment. Larvae were allowed to settle at rocky reef & rocky intertidal patches if they came within the settlement buffer distance of 7 km, after the settlement competency window and before the pelagic larval duration (@tbl:blackcod-params). A settlement buffer [settlement sensory zone; @andutta2012] is a common concept used in many BDM studies (refer to Chapter 2) and helps overcome the coarseness of the hydrodynamic model (~10 km), whereby some reefs will fall outside the physical model domain as the grid structure is mapped to the contours of the coastline.

The pelagic larval duration (PLD) assigned for individual larvae was sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a mean value of 60 days and a standard deviation of 10 days (@tbl:blackcod-params) to account for the empirical uncertainty in PLD values and considering PLDs recorded for other *Epinephelus* species [@lara2009; @jackson2014; @wilson1999]. Larvae were given a non-settlement period of 40 days, during which they were considered not developed enough to settle. A daily larval mortality rate of 10% was applied randomly to all swimming larvae, similar to that used for reef fish in other connectivity studies (seen in the meta-analysis from Chapter 2).

The larvae undergo four defined stages of ontogeny; hatching, preflexion, flexion, and postflexion [@tbl:blackcod-params; @adams1980]. During the hatching stage, the larvae are considered passive as they remain within the egg. Once hatched, preflexion begins and the larvae start developing behavioural traits. The age of ontogeny is specified using days, and the specific value was sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of one day to account for natural variation in developmental times.

While it is unknown if *E. daemelii* larvae exhibit ontogenetic vertical migration, at a family level Serranidae (including subfamily Epinephelinae), have been seen to show patterns of downwards vertical migration with ontogeny [@irisson2010; @huebert2011]. Ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) is known to influence dispersal patterns by allowing larvae to be advected by currents of different directions and magnitudes (refer to Chapter 4), and this behaviour is therefore included in this model. The values of OVM were taken for the Serranidae larvae sampled within the study region in Chapter 3 (@fig:ovm).

![Proportional depth stage abundance profile for Serranidae from Chapter 3. The width represents the proportional (within a stage) abundance of each ontogenetic stage (preflexion, flexion, postflexion) within each of three depth ranges (surface: 0-5 m; middle: 5-50 m; deep: 50-100 m) and are used to parameterise the ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour of *Epinephelus daemelii* in the connectivity model.](chapters/applied/figs/ovm.png){#fig:ovm}

Orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) is known also to influence dispersal patterns (see Chapter 4), and we know that the larvae of most species do not swim aimlessly, instead orientating themselves using sensory cues that are onset with ontogenic development [@leis2010]. While the orientation of *E. daemelii* has not been studied, the ability of *Epinephelus* to orient towards cues has been documented [@arreguin-sanchez1996; @leis2009]. In the model, larvae were given OHS behaviour once postflexion (the development of the caudal fin) was reached. Black cod larvae were given a post-flexion age of 16 days (@tbl:blackcod-params). The sensory distance, from within which it was assumed a fish could sense settlement habitat through olfactory, auditory cues etc., was 10 km (@tbl:blackcod-params). A larvae would only be able to orient and swim towards the “sensed” habitat if it was within this distance and in the postflexion stage, otherwise the larvae swim in a random direction upon reaching flexion. Olfactory lamellae, the lateral line and inner ears fully develop during the period post-flexion to PLD period in a similar species, *Epinephelus fuscoguttatus* [@lim2014]. Using the modelled OHS behaviour described in the Chapter 4 methods, *E. daemelii* larvae were given a U~crit~ speed of 0.3 ms^-1^ (@tbl:blackcod-params). The U~crit~ speed was tempered by an *in situ* swimming potential of 16%, using swimming abilities observed in other *Epinephelus* species [@leis2006a]. Larvae were assigned a swimming endurance of 50%, the proportion of each time step they would be able to swim, or one out of every two hours in the model.

### Data analysis

#### Spatiotemporal differences in dispersal patterns

The data analysis was performed on the output files of the BDM, which for each modelled year, generates a connectivity matrix, a dispersal kernel and a GIS Shapefile of larval trajectories. The connectivity matrix summarises connectivity between larval source region (row~*i*~) and settlement region (column~*j*~), where each element~*i,j*~ is the proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release period. The dispersal kernel summarises the distribution of larval path distances over the modelled period from source region to settlement region. The GIS Shapefile records the movements using the GPS position of individual larvae for each time-step, it was restricted to a subset of all larvae (5%), chosen randomly due to minimise storage requirements. Patterns of connectivity described by univariate metrics of self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance were also compared amongst regions and years. Settlement richness (the number of regions settled from a source region) and diversity [Shannon-Weiner diversity measure using the richness and number of larvae settled using the R package *vegan* — see results in Appendix C;  @oksanen2018] were also measured to describe settlement patterns. One-way ANOVAs with the factor source region (using years as the unit of replication) or year (using source regions as the unit of replication) were used to test for significant differences between metrics. Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc tests were used to make comparisons between groups if the ANOVA was significant using the R package *agricolae* [@demendiburu2017].

To address the first aim, evaluating evaluating the spatial and temporal variation in dispersal patterns, I compared the connectivity matrices using multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. The connectivity matrix from each year of the model was considered a sampling unit for each of the 19 source regions (source to settlement linkages), with each point on the ordination representing the settlement from a source region to all settlement regions for a modelled year. The NMDS used a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure with a square root transformation commonly used for abundance data to downweight areas of high settlement [@quinn2002], and the analysis used the function *metaMDS* within the R package *vegan*. To quantitatively compare for spatial and temporal variation between the connectivity matrices, I used the multivariate analysis PERMANOVA via the *adonis* function within the R package *vegan*, using source regions as replicates. To further investigate differences in spatio-temporal settlement patterns, Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) was performed using the function *capscale* in the R package *vegan*, which allows the use of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures, using the same dissimilarity matrices as above.

#### Strong and stable dispersal

To compare the strength of connectivity between regions heat maps were generated from the connectivity matrices displaying proportional settlement from a source region to settlement region, to highlight all connections (not only strong connections) a 4th-root transformation was applied to each element of the matrix. Regions of strong settlement were identified using the coefficient of variation % (CV) for settlement to a region, across the modelled years, for the entire distribution and known areas of aggregation. Strongly interconnected (bi-direction larval exchange) subregions were identified using modularity optimisation (Walktrap method) on a directed graph. Source regions were used as nodes, and the edges connecting nodes were weighted by the mean annual settlement between region, using the R package *igraph* [@csardi2006]. Communities are defined by vertexes (regions) having strongly weighted bi-directional edges (settlement) with each other. The Walktrap method uses random walks along the network to identify communities [@pons2006] and is considered accurate for graphs with a small number of vertices [@yang2016]. Strong connections were defined as having a larval exchange greater than the mean, and stable connections were those with a CV for that exchange that was less than the mean CV across the modelled years. Edges that were not strong and stable, as defined here, were deleted from the graph for clarity. Communities were visualised using dendrograms for clustering and as connected graphs.

#### Comparisons with known regions of aggregation

The final analysis for the first aim was to compare dispersal patterns predicted by releasing larvae from known areas of aggregation with the dispersal patterns predicted by releasing *E. daemelii* larvae from across its known distribution, using measures of strongly connected areas (heat map and CV) and the univariate metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, dispersal distance, settlement richness and diversity).

#### Marine protected areas

To investigate the second aim, assessing the effectiveness of the MPAs for *E. daemelii* using the modelled connectivity patterns, I compared both strong stable regions of settlement (using the CV of settlement described above) and important spawning regions (high settlement success and local retention) to regions with MPAs. Gaps in protection for protection of important potential spawning or settlement regions were identified using the connectivity matrices from the known regions of aggregation and the entire distribution.

All data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3 (Kite-Eating Tree) and the specified packages above.

## Results

Releasing *E. daemelii* larvae from across the known distribution produced potential settlement at each region within the distribution (@fig:trajectories). Larvae that were released along the New South Wales (NSW) coastline tended to disperse close to the coast in the north (apart from the top of NSW), until the middle section of NSW where larvae separated from the coast, and the southern region where larvae appeared to be entrained in mesoscale eddies (identified as particles moving off the coast into swirls; @fig:trajectories A). Connectivity was seen between the New South Wales (NSW) coastline and the offshore reefs; Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs; @fig:trajectories B). Larvae that settled between the offshore islands and NSW coast were observed to disperse long distances via currents before reaching an appropriate settlement habitat.

### Spatial and temporal variation of settlement patterns

There was a strong latitudinal gradient of settlement from source regions (@fig:nmds), depicted by a horseshoe pattern [@podani2002] over the modelled period. The northern regions from the Tweed to the Solitary Islands, exhibit extensive overlap in settlement patterns (@fig:nmds). There is a suggestion of two separate clusters of settlement patterns, for the regions to the north (1-6) and south (8-17) of Port Macquarie. The southern regions along the NSW coast showed lower variation between years than the northern regions, but more dissimilar settlement patterns between regions. Using PERMANOVA, the settlement pattern between years was significantly different (R^2^ = 0.009; p = 0.005; @fig:nmds), although most of the variation seen was driven by the different source regions (R^2^ = 0.92; p = 0.005). The annual variation in settlement patterns was not consistent between regions. Regions that displayed the highest annual variation in descending order were Lord Howe Island, Port Macquarie, and the Tweed. Eden, Crowdy Bay, and Nambucca appeared to have the lowest annual variability between settlement patterns.

Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used with a square-root transformation (2D stress = 0.12)](chapters/applied/figs/nmds-regions.png){#fig:nmds}

The CAP analysis showed distinct groupings between the settlement patterns of source regions (@fig:cap A). The northern regions (1-5), the central regions (7-11), and the southern regions (12-17) strongly group together. Nambucca is grouped with the offshore reefs—Lord Howe Islands and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs—which has settlement patterns between the northern and central clusters. Comparing the connectivity matrices between years two broad clusters can be observed, with a grouping of 2005, 2009, and 2010 (@fig:cap B). The years 2004 and 2011 were the most similar to each other out of all the connectivity matrices.

There were significant differences in the self-recruitment values between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 52.60, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests determined there were seven source regions with the highest values of self-recruitment, with means above 75% (Nambucca, Crowdy Bay, Port Stephens, Wollongong, Ulladulla, Batemans Bay, and Eden; @fig:region-metrics A). The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the Tweed region with 21%. Self-recruitment tended to either be above 65% or below 40%, with one or two exceptions. Local retention was more variable than self-recruitment across most source regions (@fig:region-metrics B), and was different between regions (F~(18,126)~ = 36.03, p < 0.001). Local retention was highest in Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Crowdy Bay, and lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs. The settlement success of larvae also varied significantly between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.97, p < 0.001). Settlement success exhibited latitudinal patterns, strongly increasing with latitude from the Tweed until Yamba and then reversing and strongly decreasing with latitude until Port Macquarie (@fig:region-metrics C). Settlement success increased again until the Newcastle and Sydney regions, after which it decreased gradually with latitude. Settlement success was lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs (@fig:region-metrics C), with the Tweed, Byron and Port Macquarie regions produced the largest variation of settlement success. Most regions had similar dispersal distances, yet several had significantly longer dispersal distances (F~(18,126)~ = 175.71, p < 0.001). Dispersal distance showed an inverse latitudinal pattern to settlement success, i.e. where settlement success is high, dispersal distance is low (@fig:region-metrics D). Lord Howe Island EM Reefs larvae dispersed the longest, with mean distances over 1000km. Of the coastal regions, Eden, Merimbula, and Port Macquarie dispersed the longest. Latitudinal patterns in the settlement richness and diversity were also seen across regions, with increases in variation amongst the southern regions (see Appendix C, Figure C2).

Crowdy Bay and Sydney had the least variation in self-recruitment between the years 2004-2011, while the source regions of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs), and Newcastle produced the greatest annual variation. There were also significant differences to the self-recruitment between years, averaged across all source regions (F~(7,126)~ = 3.03, p = 0.006; @fig:year-metrics A). Post-hoc tests indicated that in 2011 and 2008 self-recruitment was 10% higher than in 2010. The mean annual self-recruitment values were always above 50%. These two source regions, along with Eden, had the least annual variation in local retention. Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Newcastle had the largest annual variation in the larvae that were locally retained. The mean annual local retention across all regions varied significantly (F~(7,126)~ = 22.214, p < 0.001). The lowest annual local retention values occurred in 2007, which was 53% lower than 2008, the year when the highest local retention transpired (@fig:year-metrics B). In 2007 there was also the least variation in local retention between source regions, while 2008 had the largest variation. There were annual differences in settlement success (F~(7,126)~ = 27.068, p < 0.001), which followed a similar pattern to local retention (@fig:year-metrics B, C). The lowest annual settlement success again occurred in 2007, and the years with most successful settlement were 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 (approximately 1.6 times more likely to settle than 2007 @fig:year-metrics C). There were only slight differences between the yearly mean dispersal differences (F~(7,126)~ = 2.70, p = 0.01), however, post-hoc tests were unable to identify years that were significantly different to each other (@fig:year-metrics D). The mean dispersal distance per year was about 250 km (@fig:year-metrics D; see Appendix C, Figure C1 for the dispersal kernels). Annual variation was also seen across the settlement richness and diversity (see Appendix C, Figure C4).

### Identifying areas of strong connectivity

The strongest connectivity for all source regions occurred with geographically close settlement regions, although each source region along the NSW coast showed long tails of connectivity to the south (@fig:heatmap-all; for connectivity matrix see Appendix C). In general, the larvae settled in highest numbers to their natal region, the exceptions being the regions Tweed, Port Macquarie, and Jervis Bay, whereas strong connectivity occurred with the regions directly to the north or south of the source region. Below Newcastle (Sydney to Eden), source regions had a more northward settlement, Ulladulla and Merimbula have limited connectivity to Tweed or Queensland, but this connectivity was weak and variable. The offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs also mostly recruited from the natal regions and from each other, but both also connected to all regions along the NSW coastline and to Queensland, with the strongest connectivity to regions above Jervis Bay. The connectivity between Lord Howe, EM Reefs, and the NSW coastline, while weak, was bi-directional (@fig:heatmap-all). No connectivity was seen to occur to either Norfolk Island or New Zealand from any of the chosen source regions.

Regions are organised latitudinal from north to south with the exception of Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs) which are listed last.](chapters/applied/figs//heatmap-all.png){#fig:heatmap-all}

The strongest regions of settlement across the time series were Yamba and Solitary Islands, both of which were also the most consistent in having the lowest coefficients of variation across the modelled years of any regions in the domain (@fig:cv A). *E. daemelii* settlement was highest in the northern-central region of NSW when considering all source regions. The offshore islands of Lord Howe and EM Reefs, along with settlement regions in Queensland and Victoria had the lowest settlement numbers. Queensland and the most northern NSW region of the Tweed had the highest variation, but for the rest of the regions, the annual variation was consistent.

![Mean versus coefficient of variation of annual settlement to regions based on larval releases from all regions across the known distribution (A) and based on larval releases from only the known aggregation regions (B).](chapters/applied/figs/settlement-cv.png){#fig:cv}

Four identified sub-communities form the network of demographically connected regions from all possible spawning regions when considering the mean annual settlement (@fig:graph-all A). Latitude and geographic location group the communities. The most dissimilar group is the offshore areas Lord Howe Islands and EM Reefs. The next grouping is the south coast, from Ulladulla to Eden. Within this community, Batemans Bay and Merimbula have the most similar settlement patterns. The central community (Port Macquarie to Sydney) and the northern community (Tweed to Nambucca) were more similar to each other than the southern community. Inside the northern community, Tweed and Byron, and Ballina and Yamba were the two grouping of regions that were most similar when comparing the settlement patterns of all regions. Within the central community, Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay had the most similar settlement patterns.

The only strong link between these sub-communities occurred between central and southern communities, at the Sydney and Wollongong regions (@fig:graph-all B). In the northern community each region had strong connectivity with the region latitudinally above or below, except between Byron and Ballina. The northern community was also the only region to have strong connectivity to regions further than this, with strong links between Tweed-Yamba, Byron-Solitary Islands, and Ballina-Solitary Islands. In the central community, the strongest linkages were between Pt Macquarie-Crowdy Bay and Newcastle-Sydney. Crowdy Bay and Port Stephens were not strongly linked, despite the spatial proximity. In the southern community, each region was connected strongly by latitude, the strongest linkage occurring between Jervis Bay and Ulladulla. Finally, in the offshore community there were neither strong linkages between each other or between other communities.

Only strong connections (edges) with a settlement greater than the mean and coefficient of variation less than the mean were shown.](chapters/applied/figs/graph-all.png){#fig:graph-all}

### Connectivity amongst known areas of aggregation

The settlement from the known aggregation regions (Nambucca, Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and EM Reefs) was more restricted, with *E. daemelii* larvae not making it up towards Queensland or down into Victoria (@fig:heatmap-known). Three of the source regions, Nambucca, Solitary Islands, and Pt Stephens, being the areas of highest settlement and with strong consistency, significantly different from the rest with settlement at Port Stephens was 4.8 times higher than the fourth most settled area (F~(19,133)~ = 140.51, p < 0.001; @fig:cv B). Yamba and Newcastle were the other regions receiving the highest numbers of recruits (connectivity was more variable to Yamba), and the south coast had seemingly negligible connectivity (high annual variation). From the five known areas of aggregation, larvae were successfully exported to every region within the domain, suggesting high connectedness.

Using only the known aggregating areas for larval release two clusters were identified; the coastal regions and the off-shore reefs (@fig:graph-known A). The off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs were tightly clustered, suggesting equal flow of larvae between each region. For the coastal regions, Pt Stephens was the out-group to the geographic neighbours, Solitary Islands and Nambucca. Within the coastal population, the strong linkage occurred from Solitary Islands to Nambucca, and the off-shore population had a strong connection from EM Reef region to Lord Howe Island (@fig:graph-known B).

![Dendrogram of communities detected using the Walktrap modularity method with edges weighted by the mean yearly settlement between the five known regions of aggregation (A) and the graph of the communities (blue = off-shore; red = coastal). Edge thickness is proportional to the number of settlers and only strong connections were considered to be edges with a settlement greater than the mean and coefficient of variation less than the mean.](chapters/applied/figs/graph-known.png){#fig:graph-known}

Considering only the known areas of aggregation, Solitary Islands produced the most successfully settling larva, mostly through local retention (@fig:region-metrics B), but also to Nambucca, the region below (@fig:heatmap-known). This high local-retention was reflected by the low dispersal distance for larvae from the Solitary Islands (@fig:region-metrics D). However, it is also the most important source region for itself, with annual self-recruitment values of 72.9 ± 7.7% (@fig:region-metrics A). The other known aggregation regions on the NSW coast of Port Stephens and Nambucca also both have high self-recruitment at about 80% (@fig:region-metrics A). The settlement at Nambucca showed slightly less annual variability than either the Solitary Islands or Pt Stephens (@fig:cv B), but the differences were small. Pt Stephens showed the strongest connectivity to the Sydney and Wollongong regions but had among the lowest overall settlement success (and most highly variable) for the NSW regions (@fig:region-metrics C). Compared to Solitary Islands and Nambucca, larvae spawned from Port Stephens showed the strongest connections to the southern areas of NSW, dispersing with a mean distance of 112.2 km before settlement (@fig:region-metrics D).

Even though Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs both support populations of *E. daemelii*, these regions had the lowest settlement success in the model (@fig:region-metrics C). Both had little local retention and highly variable self-recruitment above 25% (@fig:region-metrics A; @fig:region-metrics B). Larvae spawned at Lord Howe Island settled consistently to all regions in NSW, apart from Yamba to Nambucca. EM Reefs showed similar settlement patterns to Lord Howe, except the larvae spawned at EM Reefs had limited connectivity to the most northern regions Tweed, Byron, and Ballina (@fig:heatmap-known). The larvae from these regions were also the most dispersed, travelling on average more than 1000 km before successfully settling (@fig:region-metrics D).

### Marine Park Connectivity

The total marine protected area (MPA) within the modelled domain is 3297.5 km^2^ (the entire NSW marine estate is in excess of 10,000 km^2^; http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), of which 702 km^2^ (21.6%) are designated as no-take zones (providing protection from all fishing activity, i.e. commercial and recreational; @tbl:mpas). However, permits can be obtained to fish in a few of these zones, specifically, MPAs managed by the Commonwealth of Australia. Several of the no-take zones have policing amnesties while the policy on MPAs is currently under consideration. Eleven of the 19 source regions (58%) contained a marine protected area of some kind. The most coverage by area occurred in the Port Stephens region, with 980 km^2^ and the least coverage was 0.78 km^2^ within the Tweed region (@tbl:mpas). The EM Reefs had the most comprehensive coverage, as the entire region falls within a MPA. The Sydney region has the most MPAs within its boundaries (10), but the total extent of the protected area coverage is only 19 km^2^, of which only 6 km^2^ (32%) classifies as no-take zones. It must also be noted that not all of the no-take zones contain suitable habitat for *E. daemelii*, i.e. sandy beaches with no rocky reef.

[^mpa]: For the Lord Howe Islands Marine Reserve, only the reef extent of the two offshore reefs, Elizabeth and Middleton reefs (88 km^2^) was considered, instead of the total reserve size covering the region including the open ocean (1880 km^2^). EM Reefs were part of the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Nature Reserve, which was included in the larger Lord Howe Commonwealth Marine Reserve in December 2012.

PAGEBREAKLANDSCAPE

Of the four sub-communities identified, each community had at least one source region that contained some areas designated as no-take zone (@fig:graph-all A; @tbl:mpas). The offshore community of Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs had the most protection afforded to any of the communities per region, with both regions encompassed by MPAs (EM Reefs has 100% coverage), and containing 58% no-take zones at EM Reefs (Middleton Reef) and 27.0% no-take zones at Lord Howe Island covering 175 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). In the northern community, three of the six regions contained MPAs (Tweed, Byron, and Solitary Islands), although the aquatic reserve in Tweed is one of the smallest MPAs in size. The total MPA coverage within this northern community is 941 km^2^, of which 148 km^2^ (15.7%) is no-take zones. The central community also contained three regions with MPAs (Port Macquarie, Port Stephens, and Sydney), with a total coverage of 1003 km^2^ (20.5% or 206 km^2^ falls within no-take zones). In the southern community, half the regions contained MPAs (Wollongong, Jervis Bay, and Batemans Bay), with 1065 km^2^ coverage, 19.2% (205 km^2^) of the MPAs classified as no-take zones.

Yamba is the region with the highest successful settlement for *E. daemelii* larvae moving both from and to it, but it does not contain any no-take zones within its region (@fig:mpas-connectivity). The next highest region of bidirectional settlement is the Solitary Islands that has a medium level of no-take zone protection. Many regions of strong bidirectional settlement had small (e.g. Sydney) or no (e.g. Ballina, Newcastle, and Crowdy Bay) no-take zones, the exception being the Solitary Islands (@fig:mpas-connectivity). Only 15.8% of the regions have greater than 100 km^2^ of no-take zone protection, and of these regions only Port Stephens and Batemans Bay have median strength connectivity. The region with the most consistent settlement was Eden, although the settlement to and from it was the lowest 40% of regions (@fig:mpas-connectivity) and it did not have any area classified as no-take zone protection. Tweed, EM Reefs, and Lord Howe Island had the highest variability of settlement patterns, and each had some level of no-take zones. For the known source regions, four of the five regions contained no-take zones (@fig:mpas-connectivity). Nambucca was the one region that did not have any no-take zone coverage. Port Stephens and Lord Howe Island have greater than 100 km^2^ of their area designated as no-take zones, and Solitary Islands and EM Reefs both have greater than 50 km^2^ and less than 100 km^2^.

Of the source regions with the highest self-recruitment (>75%), only 37.5% contained MPAs: Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, and Batemans Bay (@fig:region-metrics A). The MPAs within these three regions have no-take zone coverage greater than 80 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). For regions with MPAs, several had significantly lower local retention (Lord Howe Island, EM Reefs, Tweed, Pt Macquarie, Byron, and Jervis Bay), and for the highest local retention five of the ten regions have MPAs (Solitary Islands, Batemans Bay, Port Stephens, Sydney, and Wollongong; @fig:region-metrics B).

Habitat protection was available in 40% of the strongest predicted settlement regions for the dispersal patterns of the known aggregations (@fig:mpas-connectivity, @tbl:mpas). Pt Macquarie and Nambucca were particularly strong predicted regions that did not have protection (@fig:mpas-connectivity). Across the known distribution, Crowdy Bay, Ulladulla, and Yamba were regions of high predicted settlement that contained no habitat protection. Sydney was a region of predicted high settlement and includes habitat protection, but the total protected area of 19.3 km^2^ is minuscule compared to regions containing marine parks (@tbl:mpas).

Discussion

### Spatiotemporal variation in patterns of dispersal

A biophysical disperal model was used to investigate potential connectivity patterns of the *E. daemelii* larvae along the eastern coast of Australia. There was strong spatio-temporal variation amongst the forecasted connectivity patterns released from 19 source regions across eight years. The spatial variation exhibited a strong latitudinal gradient with consistently predicted dispersal connections between geographically close regions. This latitudinal gradient is driven by the ocean circulation off the New South Wales (NSW) coast. It is a heterogeneous system, driven by a weak flow poleward western boundary current with highly energetic eddies, the East Australia Current [EAC; @mata2006; @godfrey1980]. The narrow continental shelf off NSW increases the opportunity for marine larvae to be advected by the EAC, a 30 km wide and 200 m deep current and travelling at 4 knots [@ridgway2003]. The EAC brings water from the Coral Sea and moves along the northern NSW coast until it seperates about 30.7°S - 32.4°S [@suthers2011]. In this model domain, the separation zone occurs within the regions Nambucca (the southern end), Port Macquarie, and Crowdy Bay (the northern end) [@fig:release-regions; @cetina-heredia2014]. At this seperation zone the water mass is moved in two directions, westwards (where some water also recirulates northward) and southerly, further dispersing pelagic marine larvae along the coast of NSW [@ridgway2007]. Counter currents also allow for the northwards transport seen between regions [@coleman2011], seen in the *E. daemelii* dispersal patterns [@fig:trajectories]. The northern regions (1-5) have similar predicted dispersal patterns, with restricted dispersal in a southerly direction most likely due to the close proximity of the EAC. Port Macquarie, which sits within the separation zone, had lower settlement success, local retention, and self-recruitment, with increased dispersal distance as larvae are dispersed away from the coast by the EAC. The separation of the EAC also markedly increases the settlement richness and diversity from a source region (see Appendix C).

High self-recruitment was predicted to occur across the source regions, often higher than 50%, an unexpected result for larval fish with a relatively long PLD (30-50 days). The self-recruitment and local retention values seen in our model were higher than observed for a similar modelled species (*Epinephelus marginatus*) in the Mediterranean [@andrello2013], with the qualification that the settlement regions for the Mediterranean study were of varying sizes (107 ± 259 km^2^) and on average smaller than source regions in this study. While high self-recruitment of reef fish has been seen in regions with low levels of dispersion [@berumen2012; @swearer1999; @almany2007], the EAC was predicted to advect the *E. daemelii* larvae to more southerly regions. The estimated high self-recruitment (and local retention) can be partially explained by the size of the source regions (~125 km).

Local retention was estimated to be considerably higher for the source regions located on the coast of NSW compared to the off-shore reefs, explained by the larvae from the off-shore reefs having the ability to disperse in more directions. Considerable variation was seen in the estimated local retention, considered to be caused by the heterogeneous currents along the coast. Regional hydrodynamics along a coastline has been seen in other regions to strongly influence the dispersal causing high local retention of larval fish [@watson2010; @galindo2010] and veliger larvae [@teske2016]. The local hydrodyanmics of source regions with the nearshore western boundary current in northern NSW had the highest predicted local retention, however, high local retention was similarly forecast for source regions in southern NSW with mesoscale eddies predicted to entrain the larvae [@everett2012; @olson1991]. Estiamted high self-recruitment for a region generally correlated with high local retention, this suggests larval immigration along coastal regions was quite consistent — high local retention regions had lower percentages of immigrants larvae that in turn increased self-recruitment. Only the estimated dispersal from the Eden source region did not display this pattern. However, Eden is the southern-most region on the coastline and therefore immigrants can only come from the north.

The predicted settlement success displayed a strong gradient, suggesting regional hydrodynamics had a strong effect on the ability of the *E. daemelii* larvae to settle. Dispersal distance of the modelled larvae had an almost inverse relationship to settlement success, suggesting that the less *E. daemelii* larvae disperse the better their chance of settling.

There was considerable temporal variation across the eight years of modelled *E. daemelii* dispersal patterns, underscoring the heterogeneity of the currents both spatially and temporally. However, the effect of the temporal variation on the predicted dispersal was not as strong as the spatial variation. In addition, annual variation in settlement patterns are thought to not effect the demographics of *K* strategists as strongly [@largier2003; @cowen2006]. Interestingly, while the connectivity patterns seen in 2011 were considered to be most similar to 2004, this was not reflected in the connectivity metrics. The annual variation is thought to be the result of the combination of both the changes in the EAC that has decadal cycles and is shifting southwards [@ridgway2007; @suthers2011] and the natural variation in currents e.g. localised wind patterns that drive the surface currents and in the timing of formation, size, and rotation speed of mesoscale eddies off the south-east Australian coast, particularly in the region known as *'Eddy Avenue'* between 32°S and 39°S [@mata2006; @everett2012].

The annual variation could also not be  explained by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events La Nina and El Nino. The temporal extent of the model included El Nino conditions in 2006 (weak) and 2009 (moderate), and La Nina conditions in 2007 (moderate) and 2010 (strong) during the April-July modelling period [@bureauofmeteorology2018]. These conditions, one El Nino and one La Nina, only occurred in two of the three most dissimilar patterns (2005, 2009, and 2010), suggesting the variation was not highly correlated with ENSO events. The timing of release (only exposing the larvae to ENSO conditions during the winter months) and including larval behaviour in the model could explain not seeing an effect of ENSO conditions. Other studies have seen strong ENSO effects on modelled dispersal patterns, however, the larvae in these models were given neither vertical migration or swimming behaviours [@treml2008; @roughan2011], which potentially could allow the larval to directly or indirectly overcome changes in vertical stratification.

### Strength of connections

*E. daemelii* larvae were strongly dispersed to the natal region and regions within direct geographical proximity (latitudinally above or below). Several coastal source regions had long poleward tails in their predicted dispersal patterns, with stronger settlement to regions of decreasing latitude. Similar poleward pattern of dispersal along the NSW coast has been predicted for modelled fish larvae with similar PLDs but with no explicit vertical or horizontal movement behaviour [@roughan2011]. The proximity of settlement to the natal region is consistent with the knowledge that probability of survival for reef fish larvae decreases with dispersal distance [@buston2012]. This local settlement phenomenon is emphasised by the regions with the strongest and most consistent settlement (Yamba, Solitary Islands, Crowdy Bay, Ulladulla, Sydney, and Wollongong)  were also predicted to have relatively high local retention and self-recruitment of *E. daemelii* larvae.

Four potential sub-communities (an offshore reefs community, and northern, central, and southern coastal communities) were identified when *E. daemelii*  were released across their known distribution.  The source regions within the northern community had strong predicted dispersal connections to regions that were not the nearest neighbours. The potential sub-populations along the NSW coast were disconnected at the separation zone of the EAC and between Sydney and Wollongong. The coastal sub-populations identified from the predicted dispersal were closed systems with high local retention and self-recruitment, that has predicted can happen for species with long PLDs [@byers2006]. In contrast, the potential sub-population consisting off the off-shore islands were open systems. Potential connections between all of the sub-communities were predicted by the model, including as has  previously been hypothesised [@appleyard2007] between the offshore islands and the NSW coast.

The difference between predicted patterns of dispersal between the entire distribution of *E. daemelii*, and the regions of aggregation was the low connectivity to the southern region of the NSW coast. For the regions with known aggregations, the two most southern regions (Merimbula and Eden) had the lowest connectivity, seemingly the limit of the dispersal range of *E. daemelii*, with no connectivity as far south as Victoria. Although settlement from the three known coastal regions did demonstrate connectivity across the model domain, only the offshore reefs were connected to the most northern regions. Even predicted low connectivity amongt most regions does provide for genetic connectivity, seen in other reef fish along the NSW coast [@curley2009].  The life history of *E. daemelii*, suggests that factors other than dispersal, i.e. coastal northward migration [@francis2016], also contribute to genetic diversity.

When considering the predicted disperal from known distribution, the two regions with the strongest settlement were the northern regions of Solitary Islands and Nambucca — in constrast to surveys of juvenile *E. daemelii* that have rarely been recorded above Port Stephens [@harasti2014]. [Minor 3504]{.comment-start id="3504" author="Reviewer 3"}Most likely these discrepancies arise when comparing only larval dispersal to population connectivity, connectivity involves many other post-settlement processes not captured in this model (see the limitations listed below).[]{.comment-end id="3504"} Juveniles in these regions could also be using habitats not considered in the survey, e.g. sub-tidal habitats. These surveys also identified juvenile *E. daemelii* in the regions of Sydney, Ulladulla, and Jervis Bay, all of which were not predicted to be strong settlement sites from the known aggregations. [Minor 3505]{.comment-start id="3505" author="Reviewer 3"}If the biophysical model used in this study is an reasonable predictor of *E. daemelii* dispersal despite the assumptions, the incongruence of these survey results suggests potential unknown aggregations along the NSW coast.[]{.comment-end id="3505"}

### Comparisons with known spawning areas

[Minor 3506]{.comment-start id="3506" author="Reviewer 3"}The Solitary Islands was the only strong spawning and strong settlement region in common when comparing the predicted dispersal of the distribution and aggregating regions for *E. daemelii*  larvae. When spawing *E. daemelii*  larvae from across the distribution, several strong potential spawning sites with no known aggregating populations were identified in the northern (Ballina and Yamba) and central communities (Newcastle and Sydney). While these areas are not thought to have current populations [@francis2016], a century ago *E. daemelii* were generally more common throughout NSW waters [@mcculloch1922], including the Sydney region with an observed population at Port Jackson [@roughley1916]. The predicted dispersal across the distribution identified the southern region of Ulladulla as a region of strong settlement compared to Newcastle being the southermost settled region estimated from the aggregation sites.  Modelled spawning from the distribution identified Yamba as the area of strongest settlement, not identified as a strong area in the patterns of dispersal from estimated aggregating sites.[]{.comment-end id="3506"}

### Overlap of predicted dispersal with current marine protected areas

Of the regions containing known aggregations of *E. daemelii* only two have area designated no-take zones  over 100 km^2^ and the Nambucca region has zero protection. The offshore community is the most protected, with seemingly all the available adult *E. daemelii* habitat, excluding Elizabeth Reef, falling within no-take zones. The Solitary Islands region is the best protected coastal region with known aggregations (across all protection levels) and predicted to have high functionality for *E. daemelii* with high local retention, high self-recruitment and strong settlement. Although while the extent of overall protection for the Solitary Islands Marine Park is high, only 12% of the park is desginated as no-take zones, the lowest of the established marine parks, and the no-take zones are thought to be essential for the recovery of large Serranidae species [@friedlander2002; @chiappone2000; @hackradt2014]. [Minor 3507]{.comment-start id="3507" author="Reviewer 3"}Although, the current level of no-take protection does not seem to have had an effect on the population of *E. daemelii* , protected since 1983 [@francis2016].[]{.comment-end id="3507"} The area of no-take zones is variable between regions, however, if each no-take zone contains suitable adult *E. daemelii* habitat then reasonable protection for spawning aggregations should be provided. In the Solitary Islands, Nambucca and EM Reefs, there is there potential to increase the amount of no-take zone protection to similar levels seen in Port Stephens and Lord Howe Islands. Each of four connected sub-population—identified from the predicted dispersal patterns across the known distribution—have sizeable MPA coverage within the regions collectively, but only the offshore community had protection in more than half of the regions. Protection in a sub-population was often skewed by one or two regions containing a large marine protected area.

Metrics for identification of regions for additional protection include high local retention (population persistence), high self-recruitment (the population relies heavily on itself), and strong stable settlement [@botsford2001]. From the predicted dispersal patterns of the known aggregations, Nambucca was strongly identified as a region where *E. daemelii* would benefit from being protected due to the potential of high self-recruitment and local retention. The estimations of strong settlement to the Nambucca, Newcastle and Sydney regions suggest *E. daemelii* could benefit from increased  protection of suitable settlement habitat in these areas.

There are several regions within the northen community (Ballina and Yamba) identified using the estimated dispersal from the entire distribution that have no current protection and*E. daemelii* could potentially benefit due to predicted strong connectivity. *E. daemelii* is observed to be most abundant within the extent of the northern community [@francis2016] and therefore should produce the largest spawning events and the most settlement stage larave [ignoring post-settlement processes; @harasti2013]. The central community has the small coverage of protected areas, however, several regions within this community (Newcastle, Sydney, and Wollongong) were all predicted to have high settlement success of *E. daemelii* larvae and could benefit from settlement habitat protection. The most obvious candidate from the southern region—when considering the estimated dispersal—to benefit *E. daemelii* by increasing protection is Ulladulla due to high estimated local retention, settlement success, and strong connectivity. Warming oceans and a southward moving EAC are pushing temperate marine species further south down the eastern Australian coastline [@figueira2010; @verges2014; @wernberg2016; @suthers2011], which can cause extinction at the uppermost edges of coastal populations [@shanks2005].  Over time these changes might increase the importance of MPAs in the central and southern communities if the adult *E. daemelii*  population migrates south — mutliple areas of protection are more effective [@gaines2003].

### [Major 1503, Major 2503,  Major 3501]{.comment-start id="1503" author="Reviewer all"}Limitations of the biophysical dispersal model[]{.comment-end id="1503"}

These results must be qualified by the fact the biophysical disperal model has not been validated with any empirical data and it limits the dispersal patterns to predictions and therefore caution must be applied when interpreting the results. Model validation is an important future direction for this study — to investigate if the genetic connectivity supports the estimated dispersal. The potential connectivity described in this study is in fact only larval dispersal, true connectivity between populations involves post-settlement processes not included in this model, e.g. larval condition at settlement drives survival and predation susceptability [@caley1996; @vigliola2002; @almany2006] or interspecific competition [@mccormick2012]. Therefore, there is potential some of these strong connections could be weaker due to poor larval conditioning driven by the path of disperal. Future BDM studies should attempt to capture larval conditioning into their models when the empirical data is available. Assumptions were also made when parameterisating the biological model for the *E. daemelii*  larvae, e.g. using developmental ages from reared species and pooling taxa to get mean swimming speeds, therefore the dispersal might be slightly different than actual dispersal patterns of wild *E. daemelii*  larvae. Another major limitation is the coarseness of the hydrodynamic model used, nearshore processes will not be captured in the BRAN model with its level of horizontal resolution [@putman2013; @largier2003]. Nearshore dynamics are crucial to settlement dynamics and therefore the estimates of settlement might not reflect the real world processes [@swearer1999; @robertson1999; @harlan2002]. Many counter-currents will not be adequately capture by the hydrodynamics, potentially over-emphasing the strength of the southward dispersal and underestimating the strength of northward dispersal of *E. daemelii* larvae.

## Conclusion

In summary, for the predicted dispersal patterns of *E. daemelii* larvae spawned from regions across their known distribution there are strong spatial differences in settlement patterns driven by a latitudinal gradient. The nearshore EAC in the north and the eddies in the south have a strong influence on dispersal patterns, moving larvae southwards with moderate northwards connectivity. The northern regions had long poleward tails in the estimated dispersal and the southern regions had the most northwards dispersal. The annual temporal variation in dispersal (also driven by variation in hydrodyanmics) was smaller than the spatial variation. Four communities were identified from the potential connectivity patterns: a northern, central, and southern coastal community and a fourth community at the offshore reefs. The strongest settlement from each region along the coast was most commonly to the source region, i.e. local retention, or the regions geographically above and below. Weak connectivity was predicted to occur between all coastal regions and the offshore reefs. No connectivity was seen from the Australian coast or offshore islands to the known populations of Norfolk Island or New Zealand. Connectivity from the areas with known populations produced two communities, a coastal community and an offshore community, and the highest settlement was to the regions with the known populations. Solitary Islands was the only region with a known population predicted to be a strong source and settlement site when compared to the known distribution. Each of these identified communities, from the known distribution or populations, contained MPAs (and no-take zones within). After 35 years of protection, *E. daemelii* remains vulnerable with no apparent signs of population recovery, suggesting more management options should be considered. This work serves to identify regions where additional protection could aid in the recovery of *E. daemelii* using esitmated dispersal patterns of *E. daemelii* larvae. From the estimated dispersal patterns [Minor 3508]{.comment-start id="3508" author="Reviewer 3"}(provided post-settlement processes do not greatly effect survivorship)[]{.comment-end id="3508"}, two objectives can be identified: (1) to increase the number and area of no-take zones in the regions predicted to have strong connectivity with known aggregations, e.g. Solitary Islands and Nambucca, and (2) protect likely candidates for *E. daemelii*  habitats even though there are no known populations,  e.g. in the north the regions Ballina and Yamba and the central regions of Newcastle and Sydney. Further research should be conducted on finding aggregating adult populations through resular surveys of *E. daemelii* and protecting areas of suitable habitat, principally in locations where it has previously been found.
