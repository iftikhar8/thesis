# CHAPTER: Larval connectivity of Black Cod *Epinephelus daemelii* along the south-eastern coast of Australia and implications for conservation

# Introduction

AIMS:

1. To investigate the realised connectivity patterns from known spawning locations
2. To investigate the realised connectivity patterns from their known distribution?
3. How do the current marine parks fit in with these patterns of connectivity?

# Methods

## Study location

For detailed methods of the biophysical dispersal model used, see Chapter 3.

Black cod larvae were spawned between April-May 2004-2011 from 76 coastal reefs (grouped into 19 regions; MAKE FIGURE) along the breadth of New South Wales, matching the known distribution and spawning times (CITE Harasti). The spawning regions ranged from the Tweed down to Eden, and included Lord Howe Island and the offshore reefs Elizabeth and Middleton. For each reef, 1000 larvae were spawned daily over the 61 day period, 18.5 million larvae were released breeding season (148 million over the course of the simulation period).  Black cod were allowed to settle to reefs defined by benthic data obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). In addition, reefs for Norfolk Island and New Zealand were included as potential settlement sites, as per their known distribution.

## Model parameterisation

The oceanographic current data was obtained from BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; Oke:2013dm], see Chapter 3 methods for a complete description.

## Data analysis



# Results

## Known spawning sites

### Solitary Islands

The majority of larvae self-recruit (70%) to the solitary islands. With some going down to Nambucca and others settling in the region around Yamba (this northward migration was more variable year to year). The strength downwards was weak, but larvae did disperse as far as Batemens bay and some years reaching Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth & Middleton Reefs. The larvae never made it as far north as Queensland.

### Fish rock (Nambucca)

Settlement was highest at Pt Macquarie. Nambucca and Crowdy Bay had similar settlement sizes (SNK tests were used). Some years settlement to Pt Stephens, Newcastle and Sydney was strong.

### Pt Stephens

Most larvae settle to the region below (Crowdy Bay area), but the size of the settlement is highly variable year to year. More consistent values of self-recruitment.

### Lord howe settlement

High self-recruitment at lord-howe. Some drift northwards to Elizabeth and Middleton reefs. Makes it to nearly all areas of the eastern coast except NSW10 (Newcastle).

### Elizabeth and middleton reefs

High but variable self-recruitment. Lots of drift southwards to lord howe. Also makes it to the eastern coast in high numbers than Lord howe.

## Overall Settlement regions

The upper Northern coast, Byron, Yamba and Solitary islands had the highest settlement per year to the region. Lord Howe, Elizabeth and Middleton reefs had the lowest number of settlers (off shore islands mean more lost larvae to the currents), but they had the highest settlement to different regions. Settlement at Pt Macquarie was lower compared to similar regions of latitude.

## Successful settlement from source

The northern coast also had the highest number of successful settlers, settlement at Byron being considerably higher than the rest. The offshore islands had the lowest successful settlers overall. Successful settlement decreased with latitude.

Each region shared overlapping settlement patterns with the regions directly above or below latitudinal. the only region that did not was Newcastle, which was similar to Sydney more than Pt Stephens. Newcastle tends to be the bottom of the separations zone, which could describe these results. In fact the areas where the separation zone usually occurs -30 to -32 are where the most differences occurred between regions. The yearly variation was largest for the offshore reefs (Lord Howe, Elizabeth, and Middleton). The northern NSW regions of Tweed, Byron, Ballina, Yamba, and Solitary Islands had similar settlement patterns, driven by a strong EAC. The regions in southern NSW also had similar settlement patterns.
