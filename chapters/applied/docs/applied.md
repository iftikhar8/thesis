# CHAPTER: Black cod

# Introduction

AIMS:

1. Where do the larvae from known spawning sites potentially settle?
2. Where do the larvae from all locations across NSW settle?
3. How do the current marine parks fit in with these patterns of connectivity?

# Methods

## Study location

- separation zone (CITE Paulina)
- short continental shelf

## Model parameterisation


## Data analysis


## Study site



# Results

## Known spawning sites

### Solitary Islands

The majority of larvae self-recruit (70%) to the solitary islands. With some going down to Nambucca and others settling in the region around Yamba (this northward migration was more variable year to year). The strength downwards was weak, but larvae did disperse as far as Batemens bay and some years reaching Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth & Middleton Reefs. The larvae never made it as far north as Queensland.

### Fish rock (Nambucca)

Settlement was highest at Pt Macquarie. Nambucca and Crowdy Bay had similar settlement sizes (SNK tests were used). Some years settlement to Pt Stephens, Newcastle and Sydney was strong.

### Pt Stephens

Most larvae settle to the region below (Crowdy Bay area), but the size of the settlement is highly variable year to year. More consistent values of self-recruitment.

### Lord howe settlement

High self-recruitment at lord-howe. Some drift northwards to Elizabeth and Middleton reefs. Makes it to nearly all areas of the eastern coast except NSW10 (Newcastle).

### Elizabeth and middleton reefs

High but variable self-recruitment. Lots of drift southwards to lord howe. Also makes it to the eastern coast in high numbers than Lord howe.

## Settlement regions

The upper Northern coast, Byron, Yamba and Solitary islands had the highest settlement per year to the region. Lord howe, elizabeth and middleton reefs had the lowest number of settlers (off shore islands mean more lost larvae to the currents), but they had the highest settlement to different regions. Settlement at Pt Macquaire was lower compared to similar regions of latitude.

## Successful settlement from source

The northern coast also had the highest number of successful settlers, settlement at Byron being considerably higher than the rest. The offshore islands had the lowest successful settlers overall. Successful settlement decreased with latitude.
