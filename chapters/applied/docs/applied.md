# Larval connectivity of Black Cod *Epinephelus daemelii* along the south-eastern coast of Australia and implications for its conservation management


What's missing from this and the conclusion is that I don't think it's guided but what you think are the m son messages here. You should list those and then make sure you hit each.  And they should be motivated by the aims.

One obvious thing that's missing is much about differences when considering known spawning sites. This is rare ally as simple as saying if the strongest sources are the known spawning sites. And hw different are results about strong settlemetnsites if only using known spawning sites. Should we look more closely to see if spawning is happening in certain areas.

I'd of the sub groups is a clear one..with links to oceanography..

Temporal stability and any potential drivers.

And then maps…are there areas ( good source, good settlement) that we should think about protecting?

[This intro is very focused.  How about expanding to talk about the importance of connectivity patterns in pop bio and thus conservation and management.  Something like that.  You want to have a few paragraphs that build to the point where you introduce Black Cod as a good case study and then explain why.]


## Introduction

[Connectivity and population biology]

Marine population connectivity is often defined by the larval connectivity

[Connectivity and Marine Protected Areas]


Black cod, *Epinephelus daemelii* (Gunther, 1876), also known commonly as the black rockcod, the saddled rockcod, and the potted black grouper, is a large grouper of the teleost family Serranidae. *E. daemelii* is native to Australia and New Zealand in the south-western Pacific Ocean.
Its known distribution ranges from eastern Australia (southern Queensland down to Bass Strait) to Northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, with populations on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs [@froese2017; @zotero-2862]. Along eastern Australia, the black cod is primarily distributed along the temperate waters off the New South Wales (NSW) coastline. Adults live in the caves and crevices found on rocky reefs at depths of up to 50 m. Post-settlement juveniles are found in rock pools and shallow reef intertidal habitats, migrating to estuaries as they grow older [@harasti2014; @francis2016]. *E. daemelii* can reach the age of 65 years, grow up to 170 cm total length (TL) and weigh 80 kg. Like many large groupers, its a protogynous hermaphrodite, with protogyny not occurring until the fish reaches lengths of over 100 cm (TL), which occurs at approximately 25 years of age [@francis2016]. *E. daemelii* spawn pelagic eggs with a pelagic larval stage estimated to last 60 days [@francis2016]. Anecdotally they are thought to spawn April-May, as this is when aggregations have been seen on the north coast of NSW (@harasti2017, personal communication, 9 March).

*E. daemelii* has traditionally been under fishing pressure in Australia, considered a trophy fish for spearfishers and as a valuable food species for commercial and recreational fishers [it was commonly sold at the Sydney fish markets; @francis2016]. The biological factors of long life span, late sexual maturity, (anecdotally) aggregate spawners, have specific habitat requirements, and sedentary/curious behaviour, make *E. daemelii* vulnerable to fishing pressure. Declines in populations were first noticed in 1916, and the species was listed for protection in 1983 in NSW due to dwindling numbers, with notable population declines during the rise in popularity of spearfishing in the late 1960s and 1970s [@pogonoski2002]. Black cod is currently listed as "Near Threatened" on the ICUN red list [@iucn2006] and listed as "Vulnerable" under the Australian Commonwealth *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act* since 2006 [@departmentoftheenvironment2018]. Although it has been protected since 1983, signs of population recovery have not been seen, with it still missing from many habitats where it was known to occur in prolific numbers [@harasti2013].

Due to the total ban on fishing black cod, the current fishing-related threats to population recovery are primarily by-catch (or unintended catch) and illegal fishing. Protecting black cod involves firstly protecting known (and potential) areas of aggregation of mature sexually active *E. daemelii*  adults from fishing pressure, allowing strong reproductive output. Fish populations with such k-selected life histories are sensitive to low levels of fishing mortality, even within no-take reserves [@Abesamis:2016bc]. The K-selected life history of *E. daemelii* makes population recovery is a slow process, the current NSW black cod recovery plan has a 20 year goal to de-list it as a vulnerable species [@nswdpi2012]. Secondly, there has to be habitat protection for the intertidal, rocky reef and estuarine habitats it uses throughout its lifecycle [@harasti2013]. Marine protected areas are a useful management tool to conserve and grow exisiting *E. daemelii* populations, protecting them from fishing pressure within no take areas and keeping essential habitats protected from development. Black cod are known to exist, in different sized populations, in all of the NSW marine protected areas and a few of the aquatic reserves, along with two of the Commonwealth marine protected areas (Cod Grounds and Lord Howe Island Marine Reserve; @pogonoski2002).

Total fishing protection since 1983 has not increased the abundance of *E. daemelii* to previous known levels [@francis2016], suggesting more sanctuary zones within MPAs could be useful to limit by-catch, illegal catch, and any mortality that stems from catch and release. To increase the spawning output of *E. daemelii*, reducing fishing pressure is a key component, to both allow *E. daemelii* to reach reproductive age (~25 years), and to be able to aggregate in sufficient numbers to spawn. Therefore sanctuary areas, within their known distribution of *E. daemelii*, are an important tool to assist in maximising the spawning output. The optimum amount of coastline to protect can be measured by the fishing pressure faced, both recreational and commercial [@Botsford:2009dv]. It is also understood that for sedentary species with larvae that can disperse long distances, such as the black cod, contiguous MPAs can be more effective when comprising coastline twice the dispersal distance [@Botsford:2001ec]. However, in contrast the size of the protected coastline for protecting adult black cod can be small, due to its limited movement as an adult [@Green:2014ct]. For a population to persist, local retention is important, therefore you want to create MPAs within regions that exhibit high local retention [@Botsford:2009dv], of which MPAs do occur in several areas of high potential local retention for *E. daemelii*. Although, some simulation studies have shown protecting quality habitat areas (i.e. carrying capacity) for rock cod is more important than preserving sites of connectivity [@Cabral:2016cr]. Therefore the most important way to protect *E. daemelii* populations is to protect all known adults populations, potentially increasing the areas of sanctuary zones containing suitable black cod habitat and protecting more intertidal (post-settlement larvae) and estuarine (juvenile) habitats. Protecting habitats (which cannot move) also safeguards against the potential of moving fish populations with warming oceans, seen for many tropical species along the NSW coast [@Booth:2010ju, @Verges:2014fl], although increased competition with tropical species is also another risk factor for *E. daemelii*.

The first aim of this chapter is to investigate the potential connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii*  using a biophysical dispersal modelling approach. To observe the effects of spatial and temporal variation on the potential connectivity patterns, the biophysical dispersal model utilised eight years (2004-2011) of hydrodynamic data, releasing larvae across its known distribution. Strongly connected regions and potential sub-populations within the known distribution were identified. Comparisons were made between the potential dispersal patterns when releasing across the entire known distribution and from only known areas of aggregation. The second aim is to understand how the current network of marine protected areas, both Commonwealth and NSW, align with areas of high settlement, local retention and spawning success from the derived connectivity patterns. These connectivity patterns, from both known aggregations and using the entire known distribution, can inform management decisions about possible areas of protection to aid the recovery of the *E. daemelii* population.

## Methods

### Study location

Connectivity patterns of *Epinephelus daemelii* were estimated using the ZISSOU biophysical dispersal model (BDM) (v1.1.3; http://www.github.com/shawes/zissou), see Chapter 4 methods for a complete description. The model allows for the implementation of biological behaviours, i.e. ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS), which were utilised in this study. The model was forced with oceanographic data from BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; @oke2013], a data-assimilating hindcast model which resolves mesoscale eddies with mean daily velocities. BRAN3 has a resolution of 0.1° latitude and longitude, and resolves depth velocities at bins of 5-10 m. As with similar studies [@condie2016; @chiswell2011], an eddy diffusivity value (K) of 300 ms^-1^ was implemented in the model. Larvae positions in the BDM were updated based on a time step of two hours.


[Insert generic talk about what the model does ]

[I think you need to claify the model in general a bit more first rather than lumping it in with indication of parameters.  So perhaps above you sort of take it one process at a time, describe the flow of the process and then how it was parameterized.]

[So initially you should clarify this is an individual based model where larvae are moved through the model domain according to physical forcing from currents and behavioural processes of OVM and OHS (described below).  The length of the dispersal period is assigned to individual larvae from a gaussian distribution with mean 60and SD 10.  If larvae are over suitable reef habitat at the end of their larval period, they settle]

[Then you take it in sections:]

[Ocean currents are derived from…]

[OVM is included by allowing individual larvae to swim once they have reached an age where they would be post-flexion, Once competent to swim, larvae only do so when they are within the detection distance of reef habitat.  Individual larvae were assigned a post flexion age from a guassian distribution with mean 16 and SD 1.  The detection distance was 10km.  Swimming speed was…]

[Then repeat this sort of structure of OVM.]

[Then you say mortality was applied.]


The model was parametrised with values obtained from the literature for the species *E. daemelii* where possible. In the cases where values could not be sourced for a particular parameter, values for similar species or averages across species within the genus were used instead. If this was not possible, then general values from the review in Chapter 2 were utilised (@tbl:bio-params). The pelagic larval duration (PLD) assigned for individual larvae was sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 60 days and a standard deviation of 10 days to account for differences in PLD values seen in other *Epinephelus* species [CITE PLDs]. Larvae were given a non-settlement period of  of 40 days, during which they were considered not developed enough to settle. The larvae was considered to reach post-flexion by 16 days (with individuals given post-flexion age values using 16 days a mean and standard deviation of one day to account for population variation), whereby it was considered they could swim and start to navigate towards reefs using sensory input over a distance of 10 km. Olfactory lamellae, the lateral line and inner ears fully develop during the period post-flexion to PLD period in a similar species, *Epinephelus fuscoguttatus* (@lim2014). Using their olfactory senses, *E. daemelii* larvae were given a U~crit~ speed of 0.3 ms^-1^, which was tempered by a lower *in situ* swimming potential of 16% of the U~crit~. They were given an endurance of 50%, which period within a time step the fish can swim (one hour every two hours in this model). A daily larval mortality rate of 10% was applied, similar to that used for reef fish in other connectivity studies. The black cod larvae were considered to exhibit ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour [ Justify], and I used general values found for Serranidae larvae off the eastern Australian coast in Chapter 3 (@fig:ovm).

[The dispersal process above was applied within a model domain which included the coast of NSW, as well as Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton reefs.  HERE EXPLAIN HOW COAST WAS DIVIDED AND REEFS DEFINED. NOW YOU WANT TO GIVE THE GENERAL LOGIC OF THE SIMULATIONS YOU RAN TO ADDRESS THE PROJECT AIMS.  THEN YOU CAN SAY THE SPECIFICS OF HOW LARVAE WERE RELEASED AND OVER WHAT PERIOD AND SUCH.]

While specific areas of spawning are unknown, the largest populations within the model domain occur at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca (Fish Rock), Port Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton reefs [@harasti2013]. Patterns of annual settlement were assessed for the period 2004-2011 by spawning and tracking the settlement of larvae along the coast of NSW and offshore islands. Nineteen spawning regions were identified, 17 along the NSW coast (approximately equally sized covering ~125 km of coastline each), and two off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs (Elizabeth and Middleton reefs were considered one region due to local proximity and strong local demographic connectivity, and are thought to be a single stock [@VanHerwerden:2009vv; @fig:release-regions).

![Location of rocky reef patches used for spawning *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae in each of the 19 regions along the coastline of New South Wales, Australia and the offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth reef and Middleton reef (EM reefs)](chapters/applied/figs/release-sites.png){#fig:release-regions}

Within each region areas of roughly equally sized sections of contiguous reef were demarked as specific reef patches’ (total of 560 in the model domain with about ~25 reef patches per region, except the offshore areas which were considered one continuous reef) (as per Chapter 3) using benthic data obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). Larvae were spawned from four reef patches per region (chosen ad-hoc, unless reef patches were known to contain sightings of black cod), daily during the known spawning period, April-May, every year from 2004-2011. For each reef patch, 4000 pelagic eggs were spawned per day (16,000 per region) over the 61-day period. In total, 18.5 million eggs were released each breeding season and 148 million over the course of the experiment. Larvae were allowed to settle to reef & rock intertidal patches if they came within the settlement sensory distance of 7 km, after the settlement competency window and before the pelagic larval duration (@tbl:bio-params). *E. daemelii* were allowed to settle to other areas within their known distribution, i.e. Queensland, Victoria, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand, regions that have small or non-breeding populations [@francis2016].

Within the model domain I identified 20 marine protected areas that were relevant to *E. daemelii* habitat (ignoring most protected areas in Commonwealth waters more than three nautical miles from the coast of Australia as they do not contain black cod adult or juvenile habitat and fishing pressure on larval fish is considered to be small). The MPAs fall under two jurisdictions, the NSW Government (18 MPAs) and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (2 MPAs). The 18 NSW MPAs consist of six marine parks known to occur within the modelled domain (Cape Byron Marine Park, Solitary Islands Marine Park, Lord Howe Island Marine Park, Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Jervis Bay Marine Park, and Batemans Marine Park) and 12 aquatic reserves. In addition, the Commonwealth MPAs which are located within the dispersal area were considered, Lord Howe Commonwealth Marine Reserve (which contains Elizabeth and Middleton reefs), and Cod Grounds Commonwealth Marine Reserve (@fig:release-regions). Information on the size of the MPA and sanctuary zone areas of current marines parks was sourced from the NSW Government (http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/marine). The NSW MPAs have four different levels of protection within; sanctuary zones (no take areas), habitat protection zones (recreational fishing and some commercial fishing allowed), general use zones (recreational and commercial fishing allowed), and special protection zones (reserved for traditional Aboriginal use). For the two Commonwealth MPAs of interest, recreational and commercial fishing is only allowed by permit (and commercial fishing permits do not extend to within two nautical miles of Elizabeth Reef).


### Data analysis

#### Connectivity patterns

The data analysis was performed on the output files of the BDM, which for each modelled year, generates a connectivity matrix, a dispersal kernel and a GIS Shapefile of larval trajectories. The connectivity matrix summarises connectivity between larval source region (row~*i*~) and settlement region (column~*j*~), where each element~*i,j*~ is the proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release period. The dispersal kernel summarises the distribution of larval path distances over the modelled period from source region to settlement region. The GIS Shapefile records the movements through GPS position of individual larvae for each time-step, it was restricted to a subset of of all larvae (5%), chosen randomly due to minimise storage requirements. Patterns of connectivity described by univariate metrics of self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance were also compared amongst regions and years. Settlement richness (the number of regions settled from a source region) and diversity (Shannon-Weiner diversity measure using the richness and number of larvae settled) were also measured to describe settlement patterns. One-way ANOVAs with the factor source region (using years as the unit of replication) or year (using source regions as unit of replication) were used to test for significant differences between metrics. Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc tests were used to make comparisons between groups if the ANOVA was significant using the R package *agricolae* [@demendiburu2017].

To address the first aim, evaluating the connectivity patterns over spatial and temporal variation, I compared the connectivity matrices using multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. The connectivity matrix from each year of the model was considered a sampling unit for each of the 19 source regions (source to settlement linkages), with each point on the ordination a representing the settlement from a source region to all settlements regions for a modelled year. The NMDS used a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure with a square root transformation, and the analysis used the function *metaMDS* within the R package *vegan* [@oksanen2018]. To quantitatively compare for spatial and temporal variation between the connectivity matrices, I used the the multivariate analysis PERMANOVA via the *adonis* function within the R package *vegan*, using source regions as replicates. To further investigate the settlement patterns between regions and across years, Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) was performed using the function *capscale* in the R package *vegan*, which allows the use of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures, using the same dissimilarity matrices as above. The univariate metrics described above were also used to investigate both spatial and temporal differences.

To compare the strength of connectivity between regions, heat maps were generated from the connectivity matrices displaying proportional settlement from source region to settlement region, to highlight all connections (not only strong connections) a 4th-root transformation was applied to each element of the matrix. Regions of strong settlement were identified using the coefficient of variation % (CV) for settlement to a region, across the modelled years, for the entire distribution and known areas of aggregation. Strongly interconnected (bi-direction larval exchange) subregions were identified using modularity optimisation (Walktrap method) on a directed graph. Source regions were used as nodes and the edges connecting nodes were weighted by the mean annual settlement between region, using the R package *igraph* [@csardi2006]. Communities are defined by vertexes (regions) having strongly weighted bi-directional edges (settlement) with each other. The Walktrap method uses random walks along the network to identify communities [@pons2006] and is considered accurate for graphs with a small number of vertices [@yang2016a]. Communities were visualised using dendrograms for clustering and as connected graphs with edges of settlement below the mean total settlement between regions and coefficient of variation percentage under 50%.

[NEEDS WORK]
The final analysis for the first aim was to compare the known areas of aggregation  with the connectivity patterns across the black cod distribution, using the measures of strongly connected areas (heat map and CV) and the univariate metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, dispersal distance, settlement richness and diversity).

### Marine protected areas

To investigate the second aim, assessing the effectiveness of the MPAs for *E. daemelii* using the modelled connectivity patterns, I compared both strong stable regions of settlement (using the CV of settlement described above) and important spawning regions (high settlement success and local retention) to regions with MPAs. Gaps in protection for protection of important potential spawning or settlement regions were identified using the connectivity matrices from the known sites of aggregation and the entire distribution.

All data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3 (Kite-Eating Tree) and the specified packages above.

## Results

Larvae that settled between the NSW coast and the offshore islands often dispersed long distances before reaching an appropriate settlement habitat. Larvae tended to disperse close to the coast, until the lower part of NSW where larvae were more likely to be entrained in mesoscale eddies (@fig:trajectories).

### Spatial and temporal variation of black cod connectivity patterns

Comparing the connectivity matrices from source to settlement region between the years 2004-2011, there was a strong latitudinal gradient between source regions (@fig:nmds), depicted by the  horseshoe pattern [@podani2002]. The northern regions from the Tweed to the Solitary Islands, exhibit extensive overlap in settlement patterns (@fig:nmds). There is a suggestion of two seperate clusters of settlement pattens, for the regions to the north and south of Port Macquarie. The southern regions along the NSW coast showed lower variation between years than the northern regions, but more dissimilar settlement patterns between regions. Using PERMANOVA, the settlement patterns between years was significantly different (R^2^ = 0.009; p \< 0.05), although most of the variation seen was driven by the different source regions (R^2^ = 0.92; p \< 0.05). The annual variation in settlement patterns was not consistent between regions. Regions that displayed the highest annual variation in descending order were Lord Howe Island, Port Macquarie, and the Tweed. Eden, Crowdy Bay, and Nambucca appeared to have the lowest annual variability between settlement patterns.

Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used with a square-root transformation (2D stress = 0.12)](chapters/applied/figs/nmds-regions.png){#fig:nmds}

Using CAP analysis, the differences between the settlement patterns of source regions is more distinct (@fig:cap A). The northern regions (1-5), the central regions (7-11), and the southern regions (12-17) strongly group together. Nambucca is grouped with the offshore reefs—Lord Howe Islands and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs—which has settlement patterns between the northern and central clusters. Comparing the connectivity matrices between years, two broad clusters can be observed, with 2005, 2009, and 2010 grouped together (@fig:cap B). The years 2004 and 2011 were the most similar to each other out of all the connectivity matrices.

### Metrics of connectivity

There were significant differences in the self-recruitment values between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 52.60, p \< 0.05). Post-hoc tests determined there were seven source regions with the highest values of self-recruitment, with means above 75% (Nambucca, Crowdy Bay, Port Stephens, Wollongong, Ulladulla, Batemans Bay, and Eden; @fig:region-metrics A). The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the Tweed region with 21%. Self-recruitment tended to either be above 65% or below 40%, with one or two exceptions. Local retention was more variable than self-recruitment across most source regions (@fig:region-metrics B), and was different between regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.96, p < 0.05). Local retention was highest in Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Crowdy Bay, and lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs. The settlement success of larvae also varied significantly between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.97, p < 0.05). Settlement success exhibited latitudinal patterns, strongly increasing with latitude from the Tweed until Yamba and then reversing and strongly decreasing with latitude until Port Macquarie (@fig:region-metrics C). Settlement success increased again until the Newcastle and Sydney regions, after which it decreased gradually with latitude. Settlement success was lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs (@fig:region-metrics C). The Tweed, Byron and Port Macquarie regions producing the largest variation of settlement success. Most regions had similar dispersal distances, yet several had significantly longer dispersal distances (F~(18,126)~ = 175.71, p < 0.05). Dispersal distance showed an inverse latitudinal pattern to settlement success, e.g. where settlement success is high, dispersal distance is low (@fig:region-metrics D). Lord Howe Island EM reefs larvae dispersed the longest, with mean distances over 1000km. Of the coastal regions, Eden, Merimbula, and Port Macquarie dispersed the longest.

Crowdy Bay and Sydney had the least variation in self-recruitment between the years 2004-2011, while the source regions of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs), and Newcastle produced the greatest annual variation. There were also significant differences to the self-recruitment between years, averaged across all source regions (F~(7,126)~ = 3.03, p < 0.05; @fig:year-metrics A). Post-hoc tests indicated that in 2011 and 2008 self-recruitment were 10% higher than in 2010. The mean annual self-recruitment values were always above 50%. These two source regions, along with Eden, had the least annual variation in local retention. Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Newcastle had the largest annual variation in the larvae that were locally retained. The mean annual local retention across all regions varied significantly (F~(7,126)~ = 22.214, p < 0.05). The lowest annual local retention values occurred in 2007, which was 53% lower than 2008, the year when the highest local retention transpired (@fig:year-metrics B). In 2007 there was also the least variation of local retention between source regions, while 2008 had the largest variation. There were annual differences in settlement success (F~(7,126)~ = 27.068, p < 0.05), which followed a similar pattern to local retention (@fig:year-metrics B, C). The lowest annual settlement success again occurred in 2007, and the years with most successful settlement were 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 (approximately 1.6 times more likely to settle than 2007 @fig:year-metrics C). There were annual differences between the yearly mean dispersal differences (F~(7,126)~ = 2.70, p < 0.05), however post-hoc tests were unable to identify years that were significantly different to each other (@fig:year-metrics D). The mean dispersal distance per year was about 250 km (@fig:year-metrics D).

### Areas of strong connectivity

The strongest connectivity for all source regions occurred to geographically close settlement regions, although each source region along the NSW coast showed long tails of connectivity to the south (@fig:heatmap-all). Larvae, in general, settled in highest numbers to their natal region, the exceptions being the regions Tweed, Port Macquarie, and Jervis Bay, whereas strong connectivity occurred with the regions directly to the north or south of the source region. Below Newcastle (Sydney to Eden), source regions had more northward settlement, Ulladulla and Merimbula have limited connectivity to Tweed and/or Queensland, but this connectivity was weak and variable. The offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs also mostly recruited to the natal regions and to each other, but also both connected to all regions along the NSW coastline and to Queensland, with the strongest connectivity to regions above Jervis Bay. The connectivity between Lord Howe, EM reefs, and the NSW coastline, while weak, was bi-directional (@fig:heatmap-all). No connectivity was seen to occur to either Norfolk Island or New Zealand from any of the chosen source regions.

The strongest region of settlement across the time series were Yamba and Solitary Islands, both of which were also the most consistent having the lowest coefficients of variation across the modelled years of any regions in the domain (@fig:cv A). Black cod settlement was highest in the northern-central region of NSW, when considering all source regions. The offshore islands of Lord Howe and EM reefs, along with settlement regions in Queensland and Victoria had the lowest settlement numbers. Queensland, and the most northern NSW region of the Tweed had the highest variation, but for the rest of the regions the annual variation was consistent.

![The coefficient of variation against the mean annual settlement from each source regions (A) and from the known aggregation regions (B).](chapters/applied/figs/settlement-cv.png){#fig:cv}

There are four identified sub-communities that form the network of demographically connected regions from all possible spawning regions when considering the mean annual settlement (@fig:graph A). The communities are grouped by latitude and geographic location. The most dissimilar group is the offshore areas Lord Howe Islands and EM Reefs. The next grouping is the south coast, from Ulladulla to Eden. Within this community, Batemans Bay and Merimbula have the most similar settlement patterns (@fig:graph A). The central community (Port Macquarie to Sydney) and the northern community (Tweed to Nambucca) were more similar to each other than the southern community. Inside the northern community, Tweed and Byron, and Ballina and Yamba were the two grouping of regions that were most similar when comparing the settlement patterns of all regions (@fig:graph A). Within the central community, Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay had the most similar settlement patterns. The only strong link between these sub-communities occurred between central and southern communities, at the Sydney and Wollongong regions (@fig:graph B). In the northern community each region had strong connectivity with the region latitudinally above or below, except between Byron and Ballina (@fig:graph B). The northern community was also the only region to have strong connectivity to regions further than this, with strong links between Tweed-Yamba, Byron-Solitary Islands, and Ballina-Solitary Islands (@fig:graph B). In the central community the strongest linkages were between Pt Macquarie-Crowdy Bay, and Newcastle-Sydney (@fig:graph B). Crowdy Bay and Port Stephens were not strongly linked, despite the spatial proximity. In the southern community, each regions was linked strongly by latitude, the strongest linkage occurring between Jervis Bay and Ulladulla (@fig:graph B). Finally in the offshore community, there were neither strong linkages between each other or between other communities (@fig:graph B).

### Comparison with known areas of aggregation

The settlement from the known aggregation regions (Nambucca, Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and EM reefs) was more restricted, with black cod larvae not making it up in Queensland or down into Victoria (@fig:heatmap-known). Three of the source regions, Nambucca, Solitary Islands, and Pt Stephens were the areas of highest settlement and with strong consistency, significantly different from the rest with settlement at Port Stephens was 4.8 times higher than the fourth highest area of settlement (F~(19,133)~ = 140.51, p \< 0.05; @fig:cv B). Yamba and Newcastle were the other regions receiving the highest numbers of new recruits (connectivity was more variable to Yamba), and the south coast had seemingly negligible connectivity (high annual variation). From the five known areas of aggregation, larvae were successfully exported to every region within the domain, suggesting high connectedness.

Considering only the known areas of aggregation, Solitary Islands produced the most successfully settling larva, mostly through local retention (@fig:region-metrics B), but also to Nambucca, the region below (@fig:heatmap-known). This high local-retention was reflected by the low dispersal distance for larvae from the Solitary Islands (@fig:region-metrics D). However, it is also the most important source region for itself, with annual self-recruitment values of 72.9 ± 7.7 (@fig:region-metrics A). The other known aggregation regions on the NSW coast of Port Stephens and Nambucca also both have high self-recruitment at about 80% (@fig:region-metrics A). The settlement at Nambucca showed slightly less annual variability than either the Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens (@fig:cv B), but the differences were small. Pt Stephens showed strongest connectivity to the Sydney and Wollongong regions, but had some of the lowest overall settlement success (and highly variable) for the NSW regions (@fig:region-metrics C). Compared to Solitary Islands and Nambucca, larvae spawned from Port Stephens showed the strongest connections to the southern regions of NSW, dispersing with a mean distance of 112.2 km before settlement (@fig:region-metrics D).

Even though Lord Howe Island and EM reefs both support populations of black cod, these regions had the lowest settlement success in the model (@fig:region-metrics C). Both had low local retention and highly variable but self-recruitment above 25% (@fig:region-metrics A; @fig:region-metrics B). Larvae spawned at Lord Howe Island larvae settled consistently to all regions in NSW, apart from Yamba to Nambucca. EM reefs showed similar settlement patterns to Lord Howe, except the larvae spawned at EM reefs had limited connectivity to the most northern regions Tweed, Byron, and Ballina (@fig:heatmap-known). The larvae from these regions were also the most dispersed, travelling on average more than 1000 km before successfully settling (@fig:region-metrics D).


### Marine Park Connectivity

The total marine protected area (MPA) within the modelled domain is 3297.5 km^2^ (the total NSW marine estate is in excess of 10,000 km^2^; http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), of which 702 km^2^ (21.6%) are designated as sanctuary zones (providing protection from all fishing activity, i.e. commercial and recreational; @tbl:mpas). However, permits can be obtained to fish in a few of these zones, specifically MPAs managed by the Commonwealth of Australia, and several of the sanctuary zones have policing amnesties while marine policy is still being considered. Eleven of the source regions (58%) contained a marine protected area. The most coverage by area occurred in the Port Stephens region, with 980 km^2^ and the least coverage was 0.78 km^2^ within the Tweed region (@tbl:mpas). The EM Reefs had the most comprehensive coverage, as the entire region falls within a MPA. The Sydney region has the most MPAs within its boundaries (10), but the total extent of the coverage is only 19 km^2^ of protected area, of which 6 km^2^ (32%) is classified as sanctuary zones. It must also be noted all of the sanctuary zones do not contain suitable habitat for *E. daemelii*, i.e. sandy beaches with no rocky reef.

[^mpa]: For the Lord Howe Islands Marine Reserve, only the reef extent of the two islands (88 km^2^) was considered, instead of the total reserve size covering the region including the open ocean (1880 km^2^).

Of the four sub-communities identified, each community had at least one source region that contained an MPA (@fig:graph A; @tbl:mpas). The offshore community of Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs had the most protection afforded to any of the communities per region, with both regions encompassed by MPAs (EM Reefs has 100% coverage), and containing 58% sanctuary zones at EM Reefs (Middleton Reef) and 27.0% sanctuary zones at Lord Howe Island covering 175 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). In the northern community, three of the six regions contained MPAs (Tweed, Byron, and Solitary Islands), although the aquatic reserve in Tweed is one of the smallest MPAs in size. The total MPA coverage within this northern community is 941 km^2^, of which 148 km^2^ (15.7%). The central community also contained three regions with MPAs (Port Macquarie, Port Stephens, and Sydney), with a total coverage of 1003 km^2^ (20.5% or 206 km^2^ falls within sanctuary zones). In the southern community, half the regions contained MPAs (Wollongong, Jervis Bay, and Batemans Bay), with 1065 km^2^ coverage, 19.2% (205 km^2^) of the MPAs were sanctuary zoned.

Considering all source regions, regions with the highest self-recruitment (>75%), only 37.5% contained MPAs: Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, and Batemans Bay (@fig:region-metrics A). The MPAs within these three regions have sanctuary zone coverage greater than 80 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). For regions with MPAs, several had significantly lower local retention than other regions (Lord Howe Island, EM Reefs, Tweed, Pt Macquarie, Byron, and Jervis Bay), while out of the region with the two groups with the highest local retention five (Solitary Islands, Batemans Bay, Port Stephens, Sydney, Wollongong) of the ten regions have MPAs (@fig:region-metrics B). Only two of the five regions with the highest successful settlement have MPAs within the boundaries, Solitary Islands and Sydney (@fig:region-metrics C). While the Solitary Islands has 86 km^2^ of sanctuary zones within the Solitary Islands Marine Reserve, Sydney with 10 aquatic reserves only has 6 km^2^. For the known areas of aggregation, only Nambucca does not contain a MPA. The four regions that do have MPAs comprise of 62.3% of total sanctuary zoned area across the entire model domain (@tbl:mpas). Of the four, Solitary Islands has the least amount of sanctuary zone compared to total area, at 86 km^2^.

For *E. daemelii* larvae released from all source regions, of the six regions with the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands, Sydney, and Wollongong have MPAs (@fig:cv A). It should be noted that Sydney and Wollongong only have MPAs with coverage of 19 km^2^ and 0.4 km^2^ respectively (@tbl:mpas). Yamba, the region with the most consistent settlement, contains no MPAs. When considering only areas of known aggregation, of the three sites with the the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens have large MPAs (@fig:cv A; @tbl:mpas)

## Discussion

### Patterns of connectivity

I used a biophysical connectivity model to investigate the connectivity patterns of the *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae along the eastern coast of Australia. The results suggested that if black cod larvae were released across their distribution, there would be four sub-populations (northern, central, and southern New South Wales (NSW), and a population at the off-shore islands). The coastal populations appeared to be more closed systems (higher local settlement), and the offshore islands were more open (receiving larvae from many sources). There are potential genetic connections across all of the sub-communities, including between the offshore islands and the NSW coastline, as previously hypothesised [@Appleyard:2007us]. *E. daemelii* larvae tended to settle at the natal region or at the regions directly above or below the natal region, similar to the modelled patterns of connectivity along the NSW coast for fish larvae with similar PLDs (although without explicitly modelling any vertical or horizontal movement behaviour; @Roughan2011628]. This result is also consistent with the knowledge that probability of survival for reef fish larvae decreases with dispersal distance [@Buston:2012jq]. Considering only five known areas of high aggregation the model suggests across years, the larval settlement strongly occurs at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca, and Port Stephens. However, larvae from these five regions settled at each of the 19 regions considered, with the lowest connectivity to the far south coast of Merimbula and Eden. While the demographic connectivity to all other regions was low in my model, similar genetic connectivity patterns have been seen for reef fish along the NSW coast [@Curley:2009ki].

The connectivity patterns strongly differ amongst the 19 regions and between the years of release. The primary reason for the variation seen is that the ocean circulation off the New South Wales (NSW) coast is heterogenous. The shallow continental shelf means that larvae are subjected to the East Australia Current (EAC) from northern NSW to the separation zone which occurs on average between 30.7°S - 32.4°S, where it splits off from the coast of NSW [@CetinaHeredia:2014ej]. The water that does not split off here is further carried down the coast, dispersing larvae southward. In the model, the regions Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay correspond with this separation zone (@fig:release-regions). The phenomena is most distinct at the region Port Macquarie, which has low settlement success, local retention, self-recruitment, and high dispersal distance as larvae are dispersed away from the coast by the EAC. The EAC also explains the strong latitudinal patterns seen in the clustering of mean annual settlement by source region. Counter currents which flow north also allow for the upwards transport seen between regions [@Coleman:2011de]. An unexpected result for ichthyoplankton larvae with such a long pelagic larval duration (30-50 days), were the high self-recruitment values seen across regions, often greater than 50%. While in small areas, self-recruitment of coral reef fish have been shown to have similar small scale levels of dispersion [@Berumen:2012ex; @Swearer:1999ff], the EAC was predicted to settle particles at more southerly regions, lowering self-recruitment. The size of the regions (~125km) could explain the relatively high self-recruitment (and local retention) values seen. The self-recruitment and local retention values seen in our model were higher than seen for a similar modelled species (*Epinephelus marginatus*) in the Mediterranean [@andrello2013].

The results showed that over the eight years of the model, there strong annual variation in the settlement patterns of the modelled *E. daemelii* larvae. Although the size of the annual variation was dependent on the source region of the larvae. Other studies have seen connectivity increase with the climatic La Nina (summer) and El Nino (winter) conditions [@Roughan2011628], however the annual variation seen in the results cannot be easily explained by these climatic patterns (a moderate El Nino pattern in 2009-2010 and a strong La Nina pattern in 2010-2011; CITE BOM.gov.au). The timing of the release (April-May) could be a factor, with most larvae either settled or dead by August. Settlement pattens appeared to be consistently different apart from a couple of years, but 2004 and 2007 were the outlier years when comparing metrics; showing significantly lower local retention and settlement success. The EAC is known for its annual variation along decadal cycles and southward shift [@Ridgway:2007ez], and combined with the natural variation in wind patterns driving surface currents, serves as a possible explanation. Another related explanation the variability in the timing of formation, size, and rotation speed of mesoscale eddies off the south-east Australian coast, especially in the aptly named 'Eddy Avenue' between 32°S and 39°S [@Everett:2012bj].

The results suggest that if *E. daemelii* larvae were spawned equally across all the 19 regions, the strong sites of settlement would occur in the northern, central and southern areas of the coastline.
Surveys of juvenile *E. daemelii* have found abundance peaks in rock pools at and below Port Stephens on the NSW coast, with only one juvenile found at northern sites where adult abundance is high [@harasti2014]. The connectivity patterns from the model for known aggregations suggest that along with Port Stephens, the northern regions of Solitary Islands and Nambucca should also be areas of strong settlement. The surveys also found juvenile *E. daemelii* in the Sydney, Ulladulla and Jervis Bay regions, all of which the model suggested had low settlement from the known areas of aggregation and in the case of Ulladulla, one of the highest annual variations amongst the settlement regions. Reasons for not seeing larvae in the northern regions could be due to post-settlement process, such as high mortality from predation [@Almany:2006uy] or interspecific competition [@McCormick:2012js]. Although the larvae in the northern region could also be using other sub-tidal habitats not considered in the context of the survey.

### Effectiveness of current marine protected areas

The four sub-populations limited the connectivity between all of the marine protected areas (MPAs) for *E. daemelii* larvae. Similarly, the network of marine reserves in NSW have been shown to provide strong connectivity for some species, but not others [@Coleman:2011de]. While each of the four communities did have sizeable marine protected area coverage within their boundary, the smallest coverage (both total MPA and sanctuary zone area km^2^) occurred in the northern region, with the highest known aggregations of spawning adults on the NSW coast and modelled settlement. The settlement regions of Nambucca and Yamba, both areas of strong potential settlement and high local retention, self-recruitment, and settlement success, do not have any MPAs located inside them.

The most notable limitation of this modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions (CITE Leis). Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step  [@Burgess:2014cf]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

## Conclusion

In summary, my results suggest that *E. daemelii* larvae spawned from the NSW coast and off shore islands for four sub-populations separated by latitude (and longitude for the offshore islands), although there potential genetic connectivity across all regions. Within these seperate populations, there are different amounts of MPA protection, and the northern community, with the most known adult populations has the most concentrated MPAs and lowest amount of sanctuary areas km^2^. Considering protecting more quality black cod habitats (reefs, estuaries, and intertidal) within this northern regions could be an important step in assisting the recovery of *E. daemelii*.
