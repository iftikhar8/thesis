# Larval connectivity of Black Cod *Epinephelus daemelii* along the south-eastern coast of Australia and implications for its conservation management

## Introduction

Black cod, *Epinephelus daemelii* (Gunther, 1876), also known commonly as the black rockcod, the saddled rockcod, and the potted black grouper, is a large grouper of the teleost family Serranidae. *E. daemelii* is native to Australia and New Zealand in the south-western Pacific Ocean.
Its known distribution ranges from eastern Australia (southern Queensland down to Bass Strait) to Northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, with populations on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs [CITE Fish base, Atlas of living australia]. Along eastern Australia, the black cod is primarily distributed along the temperate waters off the New South Wales (NSW) coastline. Adults live in the caves and crevices found on rocky reefs at depths of up to 50 m.  Post-settlement juveniles are found in rock pools and shallow reef intertidal habitats, migrating to estuaries as they grow older [@Harasti:2014fk; @Francis:2016kl]. *E. daemelii* can reach the age of 65 years, grow up to 170 cm total length (TL) and weighing 80 kg. Like many large groupers, it protogynous hermaphrodite with protogyny not occurring until the fish reaches lengths of over 100 cm (TL), which occurs at approximately 25 years of age [@Francis:2016kl]. *E. daemelii* spawn pelagic eggs with a pelagic larval stage estimated to last 60 days [@Francis:2016kl]. Anecdotally they are thought to spawn April-May, as this is when aggregations have been seen on the north coast of NSW (D Harasti 2017, personal communication, 9 March).

*E. daemelii* has traditionally been under fishing pressure in Australia, considered a trophy fish for spearfishers and as a valuable food species for commercial and recreational fishers [it was commonly sold at the Sydney fish markets; @Francis:2016kl]. The biological factors of long life span, late sexual maturity, specific habitat requirements, and sedentary/curious behaviour, make *E. daemelii* vulnerable to fishing pressure. Declines in populations were first noticed in 1916, and listed for protection in 1983 in NSW due to dwindling numbers, with notable population declines during the rise in popularity of spearfishing in the late 1960s and 1970s [@Pogonoski:2002tm]. Black cod is currently listed as "Near Threatened" on the ICUN red list [CITE ICUN] and listed as "Vulnerable" under the Australian Commonwealth *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act* since 2006 [CITE oz gov webregion]. Although it has been protected since 1983, signs of population recovery have not been seen, with it still missing from many habitats where it was known to occur in prolific numbers [@Harasti:2013hq].

Due to the total ban on fishing black cod, the current threats of fishing pressure to population recovery is via by-catch (or unintended catch) and illegal fishing. Protecting black cod involves firstly protecting known (and potential) areas of aggregation of mature sexually active *E. daemelii*  adults from fishing pressure, allowing strong reproductive output. Fish populations with such k-selected life histories are sensitive to low levels of fishing mortality, even within no-take reserves [@Abesamis:2016bc]. The K-selected life history of *E. daemelii* makes population recovery is a slow process, the current NSW black cod recovery plan has a 20 year goal to de-list it as a vulnerable species [CITE recovery plan]. Secondly, there has to be habitat protection for the intertidal, rocky reef and estuarine habitats it uses throughout its lifecycle [@Harasti:2013hq]. Marine protected areas are a useful management tool to conserve and grow exisiting *E. daemelii* populations, protecting them from fishing pressure within no take areas and keeping essential habitats protected from development. Black cod are known to exist, in divergent population sizes, in all of the NSW marine protected areas and a few of the aquatic reserves, along with two of the Commonwealth marine protected areas (Cod Grounds and Lord Howe Island Marine Reserve) [CITE NSW MPA document].

The first aim of this chapter is to simulate the potential connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii* larvae along the NSW coastline over the years 2004-2011, using a biophysical dispersal model. Connectivity patterns from both known regions of aggregation to regions across the breadth of its distribution will be used to spawn larvae, to provide insights into the ecology and movement of *E. daemelii*. Using these patterns of connectivity, the second aim is to compare how well the current network of marine protected areas, both NSW and Commonwealth, match up with the larval dispersal patterns.

## Methods

### Study location

I used a biophysical dispersal model (BDM) to measure the connectivity of *Epinephelus daemelii* (ZISSOU, v1.1.3; http://www.github.com/shawes/zissou), see Chapter 3 methods for a complete description. The model allows for the implementation of biological behaviours, several of which were used in this study i.e. ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS). The model was forced with oceanographic data from BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; Oke:2013dm], a data-assimilating hindcast model which resolves mesoscale eddies with mean daily velocities. BRAN3 has a resolution of 0.1° latitude and longitude, and resolves depth velocities at bins of 5-10 m. As with similar studies [CITE condie, chiswell], an eddy diffusivity value (K) of 300 ms^-1^ was implemented in the model. Larvae positions in the BDM were updated based on a time step of two hours.

The model was parametrised with values obtained from the literature for the species *E. daemelii* where possible. In the cases where values could not be sourced for a particular parameter, values for similar species or averages across species within the genus were used instead. If this was not possible, then general values from the review in Chapter 2 were utilised (@tbl:bio-params). The pelagic larval duration (PLD) was given a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 60 days and a standard deviation of 10 days to account for any uncertainty of PLD values, with a minimum of 40 days (beginning of the settlement competency period, the first date they can settle at a habitat). The larvae was considered to reach post-flexion by 16 days (with individuals given post-flexion age values using 16 days a mean and standard deviation of one day to account for population variation), whereby it was considered they could swim and start to navigate towards reefs using their olfactory senses over a distance of 10 km. Olfactory lamellae, the lateral line and inner ears fully develop during the period post-flexion to PLD period in a similar species, *Epinephelus fuscoguttatus* (CITE Lim and Mukai). Using their olfactory senses, *E. daemelii* larvae were given a U*crit* speed of 0.3 ms^-1^, which was tempered by a lower in situ swimming potential of 16% of the U*crit*. They were given an endurance of 50%, which period within a time step the fish can swim (one hour every two hours in this model). Using similar values for reef fish in other connectivity studies, a mortality rate of 10% per day was applied to the larvae using random selection at midnight each day. The black cod larvae were considered to exhibit ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour, and I used general values found for Serranidae larvae off the eastern Australian coast in Chapter 3 (@fig:ovm).

While specific areas of spawning are unknown, the largest populations within the model domain occur at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca (Fish Rock), Port Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton reefs (@Harasti:2013hq). Patterns of annual settlement were assessed for the period 2004-2011 by spawning and tracking the settlement of larvae along the coast of NSW and offshore islands. Nineteen spawning regions were identified, 17 along the NSW coast (approximately equally sized covering ~125 km of coastline each), and two off-shore regions, Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs (Elizabeth and Middleton reefs were considered one region due to local proximity and strong local demographic connectivity, and are thought to be a single stock [@VanHerwerden:2009vv; @fig:release-regions].

Within each region areas of roughly equally sized sections of contiguous reef were demarked as specific reef patches’ (total of 560 in the model domain with about ~25 reef patches per region, except the offshore areas which were considered one continuous reef) (as per Chapter 3) using benthic data obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). Larvae were spawned from four reef patches per region (chosen ad-hoc, unless reef patches were known to contain sightings of black cod), daily during the known spawning period, April-May, every year from 2004-2011. For each reef patch, 4000 pelagic eggs were spawned per day (16,000 per region) over the 61-day period. In total, 18.5 million eggs were released each breeding season and 148 million over the course of the experiment. Larvae were allowed to settle to reef & rock intertidal patches if they came within the settlement sensory distance of 7 km, after the settlement competency window and before the pelagic larval duration (@tbl:bio-params). *E. daemelii* were allowed to settle to other areas within their known distribution, i.e. Queensland, Victoria, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand, regions that have small or non-breeding populations [@Francis:2016kl].

Within the model domain I identified 20 marine protected areas that were relevant to *E. daemelii* habitat (ignoring most protected areas in Commonwealth waters more than 3 nautical miles from the coast of Australia). The MPAs fall under two jurisdictions, the NSW Government (18 MPAs) and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (2 MPAs). The 18 NSW MPAs consist of six marine parks known to occur within the modelled domain (Cape Byron Marine Park, Solitary Islands Marine Park, Lord Howe Island Marine Park, Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Jervis Bay Marine Park, and Batemans Marine Park) and 12 aquatic reserves. In addition, the Commonwealth MPAs which are located within the dispersal area were considered, Lord Howe Commonwealth Marine Reserve (which contains Elizabeth and Middleton reefs), and Cod Grounds Commonwealth Marine Reserve (@fig:release-regions). Information on the size of the MPA and sanctuary zone areas of current marines parks was sourced from the NSW Government (http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), and the Commonwealth Government of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/marine). The NSW MPAs have four different levels of protection within; sanctuary zones (no take areas), habitat protection zones (recreational fishing and some commercial fishing allowed), general use zones (recreational and commercial fishing allowed), and special protection zones (reserved for traditional Aboriginal use). For the two Commonwealth MPAs of interest, recreational and commercial fishing is only allowed by permit (and commercial fishing permits do not extend to within two nautical miles of Elizabeth Reef).

### Data analysis

The BDM generates as output (per calendar year) a connectivity matrix (connectivity between larval source region (row~*i*~) and settlement region (column~*j*~), where each element~*i,j*~ proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release year) is the proportion settled, a dispersal kernel (dispersal path of the settled larvae) and a GIS Shapefile displaying the trajectories of a random subset (5%) of larvae. To investigate the first aim, comparing connectivity patterns from source to settlement region, using the connectivity matrix a heat map was generated displaying proportional settlement from source region to settlement region, to highlight all connections (not only strong connections) a 4th-root transformation was applied to each element of the matrix. To investigate areas of strong stable larval settlement across the modelled years, I used compared the mean annual larval settlement by the percentage of coefficient of variation.

To identify the structure of *E. daemelii* larval connectivity, strong demographically connected regions (i.e. sub-communities) were identified, using modularity optimisation (Walktrap method) on a directed graph. Source regions were used as nodes and the edges connecting nodes were weighted by the mean annual settlement between region, using the R package *igraph* [CITE package]. Communities are defined by vertexes (regions) having strongly weighted bi-directional edges (settlement) with each other. The Walktrap method uses random walks along the network to identify communities (@Pons:2006er) and is considered accurate for graphs with a small number of vertices (@Yang:2016fg). Communities were visualised using dendrograms for clustering and as connected graphs with edges of settlement below the mean total settlement between regions and coefficient of variation percentage under 50%.

To investigate the regional and annual variation, I compared connectivity patterns using multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. The connectivity matrix from each year in the model was considered a sampling unit with 19 source regions (source to settlement linkages), with each point on the ordination a representing the settlement from source region to all settlements regions for a modelled year. The NMDS used a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure with a square root transformation, and the analysis used the function *metaMDS* within the R package *vegan* [CITE]. To quantitatively compare the settlement patterns between years, I used the the multivariate analysis  PERMANOVA via the *adonis* function within the R package *vegan*, using source regions as replicates.

To investigate the settlement patterns between regions, I used the mean total settlement (averaged across years due to constraints with non convergence of NMDS solutions) to a region from a source region as the sampling unit. To investigate the settlement patterns across years, I used the total settlement to a region from all source regions for each year. For both regions and years, I used NDMS ordination analysis with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures with a square root transformations. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) using the function *capscale* in the R package *vegan*, which allows the use of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures, was used to see which regions were contributing the most to differences to the annual total settlement.

Univariate connectivity metrics of self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance for each region were calculated from both the connectivity matrices and dispersal kernels to measure the connectivity patterns between regions and years. One-way ANOVAs with the factor source region (using years as the unit of replication) or year (using source regions as unit of replication) were used to test for significant differences between metrics. Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc tests were used to make comparisons between groups if the ANOVA was significant using the R package *agricolae* [CITE].

To investigate the second aim, assessing the effectiveness of the MPAs for *E. daemelii* using the modelled connectivity patterns, I compared strong stable areas of settlement to regions with known MPAs. Connectivity from known source regions and all source regions using the graph analysis, connectivity metrics, and the mean annual settlement by the coefficient of variation (%) methods described above.

All data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3 (Kite-Eating Tree) and the specified packages above.

## Results

### Modelled connectivity patterns of black cod larvae

The strongest connectivity for all source regions occurred to geographically close settlement regions, although each source region along the NSW coast showed long tails of connectivity to the south (@fig:heatmap-all). Larvae, in general, settled in highest numbers to their natal region, the exceptions being the regions Tweed, Port Macquarie, and Jervis Bay, whereas strong connectivity occurred with the regions directly to the north or south of the source region. Below Newcastle (Sydney to Eden), source regions had more northward settlement, Ulladulla and Merimbula have limited connectivity to Tweed and/or Queensland, but this connectivity was weak and variable. The offshore areas of Lord Howe Island, and Elizabeth and Middleton (EM) reefs also mostly recruited to the natal regions and to each other, but also both connected to all regions along the NSW coastline and to Queensland, with the strongest connectivity to regions above Jervis Bay. The connectivity between Lord Howe, EM reefs, and the NSW coastline, while weak, was bi-directional (@fig:heatmap-all). No connectivity was seen to occur to either Norfolk Island or New Zealand from any of the chosen source regions. Larvae that settled between the NSW coast and the offshore islands often dispersed long distances before reaching an appropriate settlement habitat. Larvae tended to disperse close to the coast, until the lower part of NSW where larvae were more likely to be entrained in mesoscale eddies (@fig:trajectories).

The strongest region of settlement across the time series were Yamba and Solitary Islands, both of which were also the most consistent having the lowest coefficients of variation across the modelled years of any regions in the domain (@fig:cv A). Black cod settlement was highest in the northern-central region of NSW, when considering all source regions. The offshore islands of Lord Howe and EM reefs, along with settlement regions in Queensland and Victoria had the lowest settlement numbers. Queensland, and the most northern NSW region of the Tweed had the highest variation, but for the rest of the regions the annual variation was consistent. There are four identified sub-communities that form the network of demographically connected regions from all possible spawning regions when considering the mean annual settlement (@fig:graph A). The communities are grouped by latitude and geographic location. The most dissimilar group is the offshore areas Lord Howe Islands and EM Reefs. The next grouping is the south coast, from Ulladulla to Eden. Within this community, Batemans Bay and Merimbula have the most similar settlement patterns (@fig:graph A). The central community (Port Macquarie to Sydney) and the northern community (Tweed to Nambucca) were more similar to each other than the southern community. Inside the northern community, Tweed and Byron, and Ballina and Yamba were the two grouping of regions that were most similar when comparing the settlement patterns of all regions (@fig:graph A). Within the central community, Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay had the most similar settlement patterns. The only strong link between these sub-communities occurred between central and southern communities, at the Sydney and Wollongong regions (@fig:graph B). In the northern community each region had strong connectivity with the region latitudinally above or below, except between Byron and Ballina (@fig:graph B). The northern community was also the only region to have strong connectivity to regions further than this, with strong links between Tweed-Yamba, Byron-Solitary Islands, and Ballina-Solitary Islands (@fig:graph B). In the central community the strongest linkages were between Pt Macquarie-Crowdy Bay, and Newcastle-Sydney (@fig:graph B). Crowdy Bay and Port Stephens were not strongly linked, despite the spatial proximity. In the southern community, each regions was linked strongly by latitude, the strongest linkage occurring between Jervis Bay and Ulladulla (@fig:graph B). Finally in the offshore community, there were neither strong linkages between each other or between other communities (@fig:graph B).

Edges with a settlement less than the overall mean and a coefficient of variation greater than 50% were excluded. ](chapters/applied/figs/graph.png){#fig:graph}

The settlement from the known aggregation regions (Nambucca, Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, Lord Howe Island, and EM reefs) was more restricted, with black cod larvae not making it up in Queensland or down into Victoria (@fig:heatmap-known). Three of the source regions, Nambucca, Solitary Islands, and Pt Stephens were the areas of highest settlement and with strong consistency, significantly different from the rest with settlement at Port Stephens was 4.8 times higher than the fourth highest area of settlement (F~(19,133)~ = 140.51, p \< 0.05; @fig:cv B). Yamba and Newcastle were the other regions receiving the highest numbers of new recruits (connectivity was more variable to Yamba), and the south coast had seemingly negligible connectivity (high annual variation). From the five known areas of aggregation, larvae were successfully exported to every region within the domain, suggesting high connectedness.

Comparing the connectivity from each source region to each settlement region for each year between 2004-2011, there were strong latitudinal patterns amongst regions (@fig:nmds-regions). Using PERMANOVA, the settlement patterns between years was not significantly different (F~model(7,151)~ = 0.18, p < 0.05, r^2^= 0.01), with most of the variation seen occurring between the settlement patterns of regions (@fig:nmds-regions). The annual variation in settlement patterns was not consistent between regions. Regions that appeared to have the highest annual variation (across the two axis) in descending order were Lord Howe Island, Port Macquarie, and the Tweed. Eden, Crowdy Bay, and Nambucca appeared to have the lowest annual variability between settlement patterns. The southern regions along the NSW coast appeared to have lower annual variability than the northern regions, but more dissimilar settlement patterns between regions. The northern regions from the Tweed to the Solitary Islands, exhibit extensive overlap in settlement patterns (@fig:nmds-regions). There is a suggestion of two seperate clusters of settlement pattens, connected together by Port Macquarie.

#### Comparison between regions

Comparing the mean annual settlement patterns by source regions, strong latitudinal patterns were also expressed and clustered similarly as above (@fig:nmds-settlement A). The settlement patterns from source regions Tweed to the Solitary Islands were most strongly clustered together. Newcastle and Nambucca appeared to have the most dissimilar settlement patterns to other coastal regions. The offshore areas of Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs were more similar to the northern regions than the central and southern regions (@fig:nmds-settlement A).

Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used with a square-root transformation.](chapters/applied/figs/ndms-settlement.png){#fig:nmds-settlement}

Considering the annual variation, there were significant differences in the self-recruitment values between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 52.60, p < 0.05). Post-hoc tests determined there were seven source regions with the highest values of self-recruitment, with means above 75% (Nambucca, Crowdy Bay, Port Stephens, Wollongong, Ulladulla, Batemans Bay, and Eden; @fig:region-metrics A). The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the Tweed region with 21%. Self-recruitment tended to either be above 65% or below 40%, with one or two exceptions. Local retention was more variable than self-recruitment across most source regions (@fig:region-metrics B), and was different between regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.96, p < 0.05). Local retention was highest in Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Crowdy Bay, and lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs. The settlement success of larvae also varied significantly between source regions (F~(18,126)~ = 77.97, p < 0.05). Settlement success exhibited latitudinal patterns, strongly increasing with latitude from the Tweed until Yamba and then reversing and strongly decreasing with latitude until Port Macquarie (@fig:region-metrics C). Settlement success increased again until the Newcastle and Sydney regions, after which it decreased gradually with latitude. Settlement success was lowest at Lord Howe Island and EM reefs (@fig:region-metrics C). The Tweed, Byron and Port Macquarie regions producing the largest variation of settlement success. Most regions had similar dispersal distances, yet several had significantly longer dispersal distances (F~(18,126)~ = 175.71, p < 0.05). Dispersal distance showed an inverse latitudinal pattern to settlement success, e.g. where settlement success is high, dispersal distance is low (@fig:region-metrics D). Lord Howe Island EM reefs larvae dispersed the longest, with mean distances over 1000km. Of the coastal regions, Eden, Merimbula, and Port Macquarie dispersed the longest.

Boxes enclose ± 1 SD and whiskers indicate  min/max values of the distribution. Letters denote groupings from post-hoc SNK tests, performed if the ANOVA between regions was significant. ](chapters/applied/figs/region-metrics.png){#fig:region-metrics}

Considering only the known areas of aggregation, Solitary Islands produced the most successfully settling larva, mostly through local retention (@fig:region-metrics B), but also to Nambucca, the region below (@fig:heatmap-known). This high local-retention was reflected by the low dispersal distance for larvae from the Solitary Islands (@fig:region-metrics D). However, it is also the most important source region for itself, with annual self-recruitment values of 72.9 ± 7.7 (@fig:region-metrics A). The other known aggregation regions on the NSW coast of Port Stephens and Nambucca also both have high self-recruitment at about 80% (@fig:region-metrics A). The settlement at Nambucca showed slightly less annual variability than either the Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens (@fig:cv B), but the differences were small. Pt Stephens showed strongest connectivity to the Sydney and Wollongong regions, but had some of the lowest overall settlement success (and highly variable) for the NSW regions (@fig:region-metrics C). Compared to Solitary Islands and Nambucca, larvae spawned from Port Stephens showed the strongest connections to the southern regions of NSW, dispersing with a mean distance of 112.2 km before settlement (@fig:region-metrics D).

Even though Lord Howe Island and EM reefs both support populations of black cod, these regions had the lowest settlement success in the model (@fig:region-metrics C). Both had low local retention and highly variable but self-recruitment above 25% (@fig:region-metrics A; @fig:region-metrics B). Larvae spawned at Lord Howe Island larvae settled consistently to all regions in NSW, apart from Yamba to Nambucca. EM reefs showed similar settlement patterns to Lord Howe, except the larvae spawned at EM reefs had limited connectivity to the most northern regions Tweed, Byron, and Ballina (@fig:heatmap-known). The larvae from these regions were also the most dispersed, travelling on average more than 1000 km before successfully settling (@fig:region-metrics D).

#### Comparison between years

Comparing the total settlement to each region between years, the yearly patterns were equally dissimilar, aside from groupings in 2008 and 2011 and those from 2006 and 2009 (@fig:nmds-settlement B). The total settlement to many regions accounted for the differences in annual variation seen (@fig:years-ca). The years 2004 and 2007 had the most dissimilar settlement patterns over the modelled duration (@fig:nmds-settlement B). 2007 had low settlement to most northern regions, high settlement to the southern regions Eden, Merimbula, Victoria, and the offshore EM reefs (@fig:years-ca). It was also the year where most black cod larvae appeared to be entrained in mesoscale eddies (@fig:trajectories), potentially increasing dispersal but lowering successful settlement. Settlement to the northern regions of Tweed and Queensland was highest in the years 2006, 2009, and 2010 (@fig:years-ca). Ballina and Port Macquarie had above average settlement in the years 2008 and 2005 (@fig:years-ca).

Crowdy Bay and Sydney had the least variation in self-recruitment between the years 2004-2011, while the source regions of Lord Howe Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (EM Reefs), and Newcastle produced the greatest annual variation. There were also significant differences to the self-recruitment between years, averaged across all source regions (F~(7,126)~ = 3.03, p < 0.05; @fig:year-metrics A). Post-hoc tests indicated that in 2011 and 2008 self-recruitment were 10% higher than in 2010. The mean annual self-recruitment values were always above 50%. These two source regions, along with Eden, had the least annual variation in local retention. Yamba, Solitary Islands, and Newcastle had the largest annual variation in the larvae that were locally retained. The mean annual local retention across all regions varied significantly (F~(7,126)~ = 22.214, p < 0.05). The lowest annual local retention values occurred in 2007, which was 53% lower than 2008, the year when the highest local retention transpired (@fig:year-metrics B). In 2007 there was also the least variation of local retention between source regions, while 2008 had the largest variation. There were annual differences in settlement success (F~(7,126)~ = 27.068, p < 0.05), which followed a similar pattern to local retention (@fig:year-metrics B, C). The lowest annual settlement success again occurred in 2007, and the years with most successful settlement were 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 (approximately 1.6 times more likely to settle than 2007 @fig:year-metrics C). There were annual differences between the yearly mean dispersal differences (F~(7,126)~ = 2.70, p < 0.05), however post-hoc tests were unable to identify years that were significantly different to each other (@fig:year-metrics D). The mean dispersal distance per year was about 250 km (@fig:year-metrics D), but the majority of regions had larvae dispersing less than 150km before settlement (@fig:region-metrics D).

### Marine Park Connectivity

The total protected area within the modelled domain was 3297.5 km^2^ (the total marine estate is in excess of 10,000 km^2^; http://www.marine.nsw.gov.au), of which 702 km^2^ or 21.6% are designated as sanctuary zones, providing protection from all fishing activity, i.e. commercial and recreational (both line fishing and spearfishing). However, permits can be obtained to fish in a few of these zones, specifically MPAs managed by the Commonwealth, and several of the sanctuary zones have policing amnesties while marine policy is still being considered. Eleven of the source regions (58%) contain a designated marine protected area (MPA) within the region, ranging from the most comprehensive coverage at 1880 km^2^ (although only 88 km^2^ was reef extent) in the EM Reefs region, down to 0.78 km^2^ within the Tweed region (@tbl:mpas). The Sydney region has to most MPAs within its boundaries (10), but that amounted to only 19 km^2^ of protected area, of which 6 km^2^ is classified as sanctuary zones. It must also be noted all of the sanctuary zones do not contain suitable habitat for *E. daemelii*, i.e. sandy beaches with no rocky reef.

Of the four sub-communities identified, each community had at least one source region that contained an MPA (@fig:graph A; @tbl:mpas). The offshore community of Lord Howe Island and EM Reefs had the most protection afforded to any of the communities per region, with both regions encompassed by MPAs (EM Reefs has 100% coverage), and containing 58% sanctuary zones at EM Reefs (Middleton Reef) and 27.0% sanctuary zones at Lord Howe Island covering 175 km^2^ (@tbl:mpas). In the northern community, three of the six regions contained MPAs (Tweed, Byron, and Solitary Islands), although the aquatic reserve in Tweed is one of the smallest MPAs in size. The total MPA coverage within this northern community is 941 km^2^, of which 148 km^2^ (15.7%). The central community also contained three regions with MPAs (Port Macquarie, Port Stephens, and Sydney), with a total coverage of 1003 km^2^ (20.5% or 206 km^2^ falls within sanctuary zones). In the southern community, half the regions contained MPAs (Wollongong, Jervis Bay, and Batemans Bay), with 1065 km^2^ coverage, 19.2% (205 km^2^) of the MPAs were sanctuary zoned.

Considering all source regions, regions with the highest self-recruitment (>75%) have only 37.5% have MPAs within the region, Solitary Islands, Pt Stephens, and Batemans Bay (@fig:region-metrics A). Each region has considerable sanctuary zone coverage of at least 80 km^2^ within their respective MPAs (@tbl:mpas). For regions with MPAs, several had significantly lower local retention than other regions (Lord Howe Island, EM Reefs, Tweed, Pt Macquarie, Byron, and Jervis Bay), while out of the region with the two groups with the highest local retention five (Solitary Islands, Batemans Bay, Port Stephens, Sydney, Wollongong) of the ten regions have MPAs (@fig:region-metrics B). Only two of the five regions with the highest successful settlement have MPAs within the boundaries, Solitary Islands and Sydney (@fig:region-metrics C). While the Solitary Islands has 86 km^2^ of sanctuary zones within the Solitary Islands Marine Reserve, Sydney with 10 aquatic reserves only has 6 km^2^. For the known areas of aggregation, only Nambucca does not contain a MPA. The four regions that do have MPAs comprise of 62.3% of total sanctuary zoned area across the entire model domain (@tbl:mpas). Of the four, Solitary Islands has the least amount of sanctuary zone compared to total area, at 86 km^2^.

For *E. daemelii* larvae released from all source regions, of the six regions with the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands, Sydney, and Wollongong have MPAs (@fig:cv A). It should be noted that Sydney and Wollongong only have MPAs with coverage 19 km^2^ and 0.4 km^2^ respectively (@tbl:mpas). Yamba, the region with the most consistent settlement, contains no MPAs. When considering only areas of known aggregation, of the three sites with the the strongest and most consistent settlement, only Solitary Islands and Pt Stephens have large MPAs (@fig:cv A; @tbl:mpas)

## Discussion

### Patterns of connectivity

I used a biophysical connectivity model to investigate the connectivity patterns of the *Epinephelus daemelii* larvae along the eastern coast of Australia. The results suggested that if black cod larvae were released across their distribution, there would be four sub-populations (northern, central, and southern New South Wales (NSW), and a population at the off-shore islands). The coastal populations appeared to be more closed systems (higher local settlement), and the offshore islands were more open (receiving larvae from many sources). There are potential genetic connections across all of the sub-communities, including between the offshore islands and the NSW coastline, as previously hypothesised [@Appleyard:2007us]. *E. daemelii* larvae tended to settle at the natal region or at the regions directly above or below the natal region, similar to the modelled patterns of connectivity along the NSW coast for fish larvae with similar PLDs (although without explicitly modelling any vertical or horizontal movement behaviour; @Roughan2011628]. This result is also consistent with the knowledge that probability of survival for reef fish larvae decreases with dispersal distance [@Buston:2012jq]. Considering only five known areas of high aggregation the model suggests across years, the larval settlement strongly occurs at the regions Solitary Islands, Nambucca, and Port Stephens. However, larvae from these five regions settled at each of the 19 regions considered, with the lowest connectivity to the far south coast of Merimbula and Eden. While the demographic connectivity to all other regions was low in my model, similar genetic connectivity patterns have been seen for reef fish along the NSW coast [@Curley:2009ki].

The connectivity patterns strongly differ amongst the 19 regions and between the years of release. The primary reason for the variation seen is that the ocean circulation off the New South Wales (NSW) coast is heterogenous. The shallow continental shelf means that larvae are subjected to the East Australia Current (EAC) from northern NSW to the separation zone which occurs on average between 30.7°S - 32.4°S, where it splits off from the coast of NSW [@CetinaHeredia:2014ej]. The water that does not split off here is further carried down the coast, dispersing larvae southward. In the model, the regions Port Macquarie and Crowdy Bay correspond with this separation zone (@fig:release-regions). The phenomena is most distinct at the region Port Macquarie, which has low settlement success, local retention, self-recruitment, and high dispersal distance as larvae are dispersed away from the coast by the EAC. The EAC also explains the strong latitudinal patterns seen in the clustering of mean annual settlement by source region. Counter currents which flow north also allow for the upwards transport seen between regions [@Coleman:2011de]. An unexpected result for ichthyoplankton larvae with such a long pelagic larval duration (30-50 days), were the high self-recruitment values seen across regions, often greater than 50%. While in small areas, self-recruitment of coral reef fish have been shown to have similar small scale levels of dispersion [@Berumen:2012ex; @Swearer:1999ff], the EAC was predicted to settle particles at more southerly regions, lowering self-recruitment. The size of the regions (~125km) could explain the relatively high self-recruitment (and local retention) values seen. The self-recruitment and local retention values seen in our model were higher than seen for a similar modelled species (*Epinephelus marginatus*) in the Mediterranean [@Andrello:2013cc].

The results showed that over the eight years of the model, there strong annual variation in the settlement patterns of the modelled *E. daemelii* larvae. Although the size of the annual variation was dependent on the source region of the larvae. Other studies have seen connectivity increase with the climatic La Nina (summer) and El Nino (winter) conditions [@Roughan2011628], however the annual variation seen in the results cannot be easily explained by these climatic patterns (a moderate El Nino pattern in 2009-2010 and a strong La Nina pattern in 2010-2011; CITE BOM.gov.au). The timing of the release (April-May) could be a factor, with most larvae either settled or dead by August. Settlement pattens appeared to be consistently different apart from a couple of years, but 2004 and 2007 were the outlier years when comparing metrics; showing significantly lower local retention and settlement success. The EAC is known for its annual variation along decadal cycles and southward shift [@Ridgway:2007ez], and combined with the natural variation in wind patterns driving surface currents, serves as a possible explanation. Another related explanation the variability in the timing of formation, size, and rotation speed of mesoscale eddies off the south-east Australian coast, especially in the aptly named 'Eddy Avenue' between 32°S and 39°S [@Everett:2012bj].

The results suggest that if *E. daemelii* larvae were spawned equally across all the 19 regions, the strong sites of settlement would occur in the northern, central and southern areas of the coastline.
Surveys of juvenile *E. daemelii* have found abundance peaks in rock pools at and below Port Stephens on the NSW coast, with only one juvenile found at northern sites where adult abundance is high [@Harasti:2014fk]. The connectivity patterns from the model for known aggregations suggest that along with Port Stephens, the northern regions of Solitary Islands and Nambucca should also be areas of strong settlement. The surveys also found juvenile *E. daemelii* in the Sydney, Ulladulla and Jervis Bay regions, all of which the model suggested had low settlement from the known areas of aggregation and in the case of Ulladulla, one of the highest annual variations amongst the settlement regions. Reasons for not seeing larvae in the northern regions could be due to post-settlement process, such as high mortality from predation [@Almany:2006uy] or interspecific competition [@McCormick:2012js]. Although the larvae in the northern region could also be using other sub-tidal habitats not considered in the context of the survey.

### Effectiveness of current marine protected areas

The four sub-populations limited the connectivity between all of the marine protected areas (MPAs) for *E. daemelii* larvae. Similarly, the network of marine reserves in NSW have been shown to provide strong connectivity for some species, but not others [@Coleman:2011de]. While each of the four communities did have sizeable marine protected area coverage within their boundary, the smallest coverage (both total MPA and sanctuary zone area km^2^) occurred in the northern region, with the highest known aggregations of spawning adults on the NSW coast and modelled settlement. The settlement regions of Nambucca and Yamba, both areas of strong potential settlement and high local retention, self-recruitment, and settlement success, do not have any MPAs located inside them.

Total fishing protection since 1983 has not increased the abundance of *E. daemelii* to previous known levels [@Francis:2016kl], suggesting more sanctuary zones within MPAs could be useful to limit by-catch, illegal catch, and any mortality that stems from catch and release. To increase the spawning output of *E. daemelii*, reducing fishing pressure is a key component, to both allow *E. daemelii* to reach reproductive age (~25 years), and to be able to aggregate in sufficient numbers to spawn. Therefore sanctuary areas, within their known distribution of *E. daemelii*, are an important tool to assist in maximising the spawning output. The optimum amount of coastline to protect can be measured by the fishing pressure faced, both recreational and commercial [@Botsford:2009dv]. It is also understood that for sedentary species with larvae that can disperse long distances, such as the black cod, contiguous MPAs can be more effective when comprising coastline twice the dispersal distance [@Botsford:2001ec]. However, in contrast the size of the protected coastline for protecting adult black cod can be small, due to its limited movement as an adult [@Green:2014ct]. For a population to persist, local retention is important, therefore you want to create MPAs within regions that exhibit high local retention [@Botsford:2009dv], of which MPAs do occur in several areas of high potential local retention for *E. daemelii*. Although, some simulation studies have shown protecting quality habitat areas (i.e. carrying capacity) for rock cod is more important than preserving sites of connectivity [@Cabral:2016cr]. Therefore the most important way to protect *E. daemelii* populations is to protect all known adults populations, potentially increasing the areas of sanctuary zones containing suitable black cod habitat and protecting more intertidal (post-settlement larvae) and estuarine (juvenile) habitats. Protecting habitats (which cannot move) also safeguards against the potential of moving fish populations with warming oceans, seen for many tropical species along the NSW coast [@Booth:2010ju, @Verges:2014fl], although increased competition with tropical species is also another risk factor for *E. daemelii*.

The most notable limitation of this modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions (CITE Leis). Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step  [@Burgess:2014cf]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

## Conclusion

In summary, my results suggest that *E. daemelii* larvae spawned from the NSW coast and off shore islands for four sub-populations separated by latitude (and longitude for the offshore islands), although there potential genetic connectivity across all regions. Within these seperate populations, there are different amounts of MPA protection, and the northern community, with the most known adult populations has the most concentrated MPAs and lowest amount of sanctuary areas km^2^. Considering protecting more quality black cod habitats (reefs, estuaries, and intertidal) within this northern regions could be an important step in assisting the recovery of *E. daemelii*.
