# CHAPTER: Black cod

# Introduction

AIMS:

1. Where do the larvae from known spawning sites potentially settle?
2. Where do the larvae from all locations across NSW settle?
3. How do the current marine parks fit in with these patterns of connectivity?

# Methods

## Study location

- separation zone (CITE Paulina)
- short continental shelf

## Model parameterisation


## Data analysis


## Study site



# Results

## Known spawning sites


### Pt Stephens

Most larvae settle to the region below (Crowdy Bay area), but the size of the settlement is highly variable year to year. More consistent values of self-recruitment.

### Lord howe settlement

High self-recruitment at lord-howe. Some drift northwards to Elizabeth and Middleton reefs. Makes it to nearly all areas of the eastern coast except NSW10 (Newcastle).

### Elizabeth and middleton reefs

Hig but variable self-recruitment. Lots of drift southwards to lord howe. Also makes it to the eastern coast in high numbers than Lord howe.
