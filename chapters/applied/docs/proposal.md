# Proposal for applied chapter

Investigate how the Commonweath marine parks (particulary the Temperate East Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network) assist in the connectivity of the threatened black cod (Epinephelus daemelii).

## Biology
The larvae recruit to coastal rockpools (the juveniles later move into estuaries).
## Distribution
Found in warm temperate to temperate waters of south-eastern Australia, from southern Queensland to Mallacoota, Victoria (rarely further westwards), Tasman Sea islands and seamounts – Norfolk Island, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs, Lord Howe Island, to New Zealand – the Kermadec Islands, the North Island and the Poor Knights Islands. Depth range 1-50 m.
Inhabits caves, gutters and crevices usually to depths of 50 m, although individuals have been collected from below 100 m. Juveniles are found inshore, often in coastal rockpools and estuaries.
Black Rockcod are very territorial and individuals have relatively small home ranges. Smaller individuals are regularly seen in caves and gutters around Lord Howe Island.

## PLD
Not known as far as I can tell. Perhaps gather ones for other Epinephelus and use an average of those.

## Marine parks
Idea would be to look at the connectivity patterns and see how the marine parks fit into this.
