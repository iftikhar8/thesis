OHS DISCUSSION
--------------

Shown OHS is an important factor, making issues of ocean acidification, which can remove ability to sense an even greater issue [@rossi2016], and could possibly make this finding mute.

Modelling Issues
----------------

Need to validate Without validation these models are also only models.

### Limitations and future directions.

The most notable limitation of this modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

#### MPA connectivity

The optimum amount of coastline to protect black cod populations can be measured by the fishing pressure faced, both recreational and commercial [@botsford2009]. Its also understood that for sedentary species with larvae that can disperse long distances, such as the black cod, contiguous MPAs can be more effective when comprising coastline twice the dispersal distance [@botsford2001]. However, in contrast the size of the protected coastline for protecting adult black cod can be small, due to its limited movement as an adult [@Green:2014ct]. For a population to persist, local retention is important, therefore creating MPAs within regions that exhibit high local retention is crucial [@botsford2009], Although, some simulation studies have shown protecting quality habitat areas (i.e. carrying capacity) for rock cod is more important than preserving sites of connectivity [@Cabral:2016cr].
