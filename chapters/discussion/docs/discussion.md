Discussion
==========

The overarching theme of this thesis was to contribute to the understanding of the processes that influence the dispersal and connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton. I have been able to give new insights into the connectivity of ichthyoplankton using a combination of meta-analysis of recent ichthyoplankton biophysical dispersal model (BDM) studies, an empirical study on the ontogenetic vertical distribution of ichthyoplankton, a theoretical modelling study investigates the influence of ichthyoplankton behaviours on connectivity, and finally predicting the connectivity of a reef fish (*Epinephelus daemelii*) using a BDM model to predict its ichthyoplankton dispersal. The results of this thesis have implications for both the considerations of future BDM studies and the conservation and management of the black cod *E. daemelii*. This section summarises the key findings of the thesis, providing summations of each data chapter and addressing similarities, differences, and implications for the field. In addition, the limitations of BDM studies are addressed, and directions and recommendations for future research are discussed.

## Summary of key findings

### Modelling decisions

Biophysical dispersal models (BDM) are a useful tool to measure ichthyoplankton connectivity in the absence of easily obtained empirical results, however these models are not without complexity. BDMs are becoming more prevalent and complex as computing power increases and at the same time becomes more affordable [@mumby2017]. Complexity arises from coupling together both physical and biological models, creating an influx of modelling parameters and therefore choices on values for these parameters. Each of these choices augments the degree of uncertainty about the BDM and the accuracy of the output. To minimise this uncertainty, one approach is to use applicable model choices (i.e. generalities) from prior BDM studies. Therefore, to understand the trends of parameter choices (and their influence on connectivity), in Chapter 2 I undertook a meta-analysis of connectivity studies using BDMs. The meta-analysis looked at papers published from 2009 due to the coinciding of the publication of an ICES manual detailing a recommended approach BDMs studies [@north2009]. The first aim of the chapter was to identify the trends of parameters included in BDMs for both the physical and biological models. The physical models were becoming more complex, using hydrodynamic models with increasing spatial resolution and also nesting regional hydrodynamic models to capture spatial oceanography accurately, e.g. different hydrodynamic models for near-shore and off-shore processes. Biological models were found to be getting more complex, with modellers including more complex behaviour over time, most likely correlated with increased knowledge of ichthyoplankton life history. However, there was still a strong tendency to using passive transport models, a surprising result given that it has been known for over a decade that reef fish larvae can influence their dispersal though vertical migration [@paris2004a], or through sensory abilities [@gerlach2007a], and its generally accepted that reef fish become nektonic before they settle [@leis2006].

The second aim of the meta-analysis examined the influence of these parameters on commonly identified metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance) of connectivity amongst the studies. Considerable variation was seen amongst the reported values for each of the metrics. This result highlights the differences in connectivity patterns both across regions and the effect parameter choice has on input parameters. The large suite of input parameters reduced the ability to perform analysis across all combinations, often clear reporting of all included parameters and subsequent values used in a BDM was not available. Comparisons between studies are also inherently difficult because of the differences in models choices, based on principles such as study regions, species, or available knowledge. However, I was able to derived several patterns of model choices on connectivity metrics. Firstly, in an open oceanic system (as compared to closed), the dispersal distance of ichthyoplankton was found to be longer and the local retention to a natal site was reduced. The model resolution was found to not have strong effects on the connectivity metrics. Metrics were not correlated with the choice of hydrodynamic or particle tracking model. Hydrodynamic model resolution did not effect the metrics of connectivity, but using nested hydrodynamic models did result in reduced self-recruitment. Of the biological parameters investigated, the length of the pelagic larval duration and settlement competency window had no strong effects on the metrics. Surprisingly, including larval mortality in a BDM did not change the impact the settlement success to the extent expected. However, including any behaviour increased the settlement success of ichthyoplankton and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) reduced self-recruitment. The complexity of studies using BDMs make it difficult to derive generalities across studies to inform the influence of parameter choice on connectivity patterns. This difficulty is magnified when there is no consensus on how to report metrics describing the results, leading to impediments in understanding the influence of modelling choices. To progress this field further there is a need to decide upon common metrics that allow meaningful comparisons between models, which is addressed below. This review provides researchers with more context on what parameters are important to include in future BDM studies.

### Chapter 3

As mentioned throughout this thesis, a challenge of using BDMs to predict connectivity is the obscurity of data on the early-life history for many study species of interest. Modellers are often compelled to introduce some degree of assumption in parameter choice for biological models for behaviours known to be crucial to larval dispersal, i.e. by using values of conspecifics, congeners [Chapter 5; @young2012], or general values [Chapter 5; @corell2012]. The other option for researchers is to remove all uncertainty through the removal of a specific behaviour (even if is known to influence connectivity) from the BDM if parameter information is unavailable [@andrello2013]. Thus connectivity modelling requires balancing the inclusion of realistic biological processes against limiting the number of assumptions required to parameterise these processes. The primary way of reducing modelling assumptions is through the collection of more empirical data on ichthyoplankton.

Ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) is an ichthyoplankton behaviour known to influence dispersal by exposing larvae to currents with variable strengths and directions across the water column. OVM has not previously been explicitly been studied for ichthyoplankton of NSW. To address this knowledge gap with the goal of using the data to parameterise a BDM, Chapter 3 measured the ontogenetic vertical distribution of seven reef fish families off the coast of NSW. The ontogenetic stage (preflexion, flexion, and postflexion) and length of the larval fish were measured at three different depth bins; 0-5 m, 5-50 m, and 50-100 m. In addition, I also investigated any differences in these patterns between water masses, i.e. coastal or eddy waters. The experimental methodology, a common technique [@barnett1984; @paris2004a; @irisson2010], does not explicitly capture OVM behaviour, but it does give a robust estimate of where the centre of mass is for each ichthyoplankton ontogenetic stage. Capturing the OVM behaviour of larval fish in the wild is essentially beyond our current technologies [CITE], e.g. its impossible for divers to follow ichthyoplankton over increasing spatial and temporal scales.

In general, the larvae of reef fish families were found to migrate deeper with ontogeny and length. This pattern has been seen in other studies looking at the vertical distribution of reef fish [@irisson2010; @huebert2011]. Mullidae were the exception to this general pattern, migrating upwards towards the surface waters with ontogeny, a position postflexion larvae have been found previously off NSW [@gray1993]. The water mass did not have an effect on the vertical distribution, suggesting that vertical migration behaviour is determined by other factors. Although, entrainment within an eddy did in general produce as expected, older and longer larvae [@shulzitski2016]. Vertical distribution patterns of ichthyoplankton are known to be highly variable both within and between species, therefore often results are contrasting, e.g. Scorpaenidae; in Chapter 3 I found a strong ontogenetic shift downwards, yet other studies have found either no ontogenetic movement [@huebert2011] or postflexion larvae at the surface [@kuwahara1983]. The discrepancies seen could be differences between species within a taxonomic grouping, often studies group ichthyoplankton into taxonomic families (as seen in Chapter 3) due to the expert knowledge required to use morphological diagnostics to identify larval fish down to a species level. Species identification is predicted to become less of an issue as genetic techniques such as DNA barcoding for larval fish mature and become cheaper for researchers to access [@hubert2015]. The variation in results can also be driven by differences in species at geographic locations, fish are known to behave differently in tropical or temperate environments, i.e. latitudinal differences [@houde1989; @figueira2009a; @leis2013]. Another reason for the observed discrepancies could be due to sampling effort, its impractical to expect balanced designs when sampling for larval fish in a vast oceanic system, compounded by sampling for *n* ontogenetic stages over *m* depths. Complicating the sampling effort more are factors such as net avoidance of postflexion ichthyoplankton, high mortality rates, and the general patchiness of distributions. Inherent differences between species across geographic locations is one concern, but also the difficulty in getting equal sampling efforts across ontogenetic stages and depths due to net avoidance of postflexion fish [@leis2006] and general patchiness in distributions [@gray1993; @cowen1993] contributes to these issues. Deriving general patterns for OVM for species might be impossible, meaning studies across latitudes are required to understand if differences exist. Contrasting results is not always possible due to the limited research on OVM patterns for non-harvest or non-tropical species, e.g. the Synodontidae patterns in Chapter 3.

### Chapter 4

With the understanding that behaviours of ichthyoplankton affect dispersal and connectivity patterns [@leis2007], the endeavour of Chapter 4 was to investigate the relative influence of some behaviours on connectivity using a BDM. This was done twofold, firstly through investigating the effect of combinations of different ichthyoplankton behaviours, and secondly by changing both the parameter values and implementation of a specific behaviour. The ichthyoplankton behaviours were parameterised using a combination of data from the literature and the ontogenetic vertical distribution results obtained in Chapter 3. The behaviours used in the study were chosen because they are known to influence dispersal and connectivity patterns [@leis2007]; OVM [@paris2004a], DVM [diel vertical migration; @aiken2011], and OHS [@staaterman2012]. In general, including behaviour in a model increased local retention or reduced the dispersal distance, confirming similar results in other studies [@shanks2009; @paris2007a]. This is not universal amongst studies, sometimes opposite patterns are seen, e.g. including behaviour can increase dispersal [@ospina-alvarez2012]. Although there was an effect of behaviour in this study, it must be noted the strongest effect on regional settlement patterns was the choice of location and timing of larval release.

Amongst the different behaviours considered, OHS was the most influential and OVM to be the least influential on the patterns of ichthyoplankton connectivity. Other studies have found similar results for OHS, with reduced dispersal distance and increased local retention [@wolanski2014a; @staaterman2012]. Despite this strong effect, OHS was only found to be implemented in a small number of studies in the Chapter 2 review. The reason for a limited number of studies implementing OHS could be it was not thought to be as influential as seen in Chapter 4, or empirical data to parameterise the behaviour was unknown for particular study species. Orientation behaviour is a relatively new field of interest and not yet fully understood, yet these result suggest including OHS behaviour in future connectivity studies of ichthyoplankton should be a priority, especially in similar coastal regions with near-shore boundary currents. It emphasises the importance of building upon the empirical research into the sensory abilities of larval fish (e.g. hearing, vision, and chemosensation) and how they discern habitat cues using these senses [@faillettaz2015; @berenshtein2014a; @leis2014]. Swimming speeds however, are one of the more well studied facets of ichthyoplankton early-life history [@fisher2000; @hogan2007; @leis1997; @stobutzki1997], allowing for less assumptions in model parameterisation. The connectivity patterns derived using larvae with OVM only exhibited a small sensitivity to different vertical distribution patterns seen in Chapter 3. The sensitivity of dispersal patterns was greater when the ontogenetic distribution was kept constant, but the timing of movement for individual larva between depths was altered. This result leads to the conclusion that its more important to accurately model the processes of a specific behaviour than get the parameter values precise. It also infers that for behaviours, at least OVM behaviours, using assumptions to parametrise the behaviour have less influence than not including the behaviour at all. These results accentuate the importance of sensitivity analyses in BDM studies and how researchers should aspire to publishing or make the results of sensitivity analyses available [@simons2013].

## Chapter 5

The final chapter of this thesis (Chapter 5) took an applied BDM approach, building upon the results of each of the previous data chapters. The primary aim was to predict the larval connectivity patterns of the black cod [*Epinephelus daemelii*; @francis2016], a protected species of NSW. The BDM included the ichthyoplankton behaviours OHS and OVM due to the results in Chapter 4. The OVM behaviour was parameterised using the vertical distribution results obtained in Chapter 3 for Serranidae in NSW. *E. daemelii* larvae were released over the period 2004-2011 across its entire known distribution in NSW, the entire coastline and the offshore islands, Elizabeth and Middleton reefs and Lord Howe Island. The larval dispersal of *E. daemelii* was assessed to determine the connectivity of regions with the distribution, specifically regions of strong source and settlement, i.e. consistently high over the entire release period. Despite being protected since 1983 due to acute population decline [@francis2016], *E. daemelii* has not been seen to increase in numbers. One potential cause for seeing no change in population size is the current marine reserve network (i.e. MPA) in NSW is not structured to benefit *E. daemelii*. Therefore, utilising the modelled connectivity patterns, the second aim was to compare these results, from both across the entire distribution and considering only known regions of aggregation, to ascertain if there are gaps within the existing marine protected network and if so, what regions should be prioritised for protection.

Despite the near-shore boundary current along the NSW coastline, e.g. the Eastern Australian Current (EAC), I found the strongest connectivity of *E. daemelii* larvae occurred either at the natal region or the regions of nearest latitude. There was dispersal between most regions across the known distribution, providing the potential of genetic connectivity, with dispersal tailing in a polewards direction (i.e. the direction of the EAC). This included weak connectivity between the NSW coastline and the off-shore islands, connectivity that has previously been hypothesised to occur [@appleyard2007]. Four sub-populations of strong settlement were identified from the results using graph theory; a northern, central, southern population along the NSW coastline, and an off-shore reef population. There was strong demographic connectivity within these populations, but importantly also some connectivity between all these populations. When comparing this potential connectivity with current marine protected areas, it was found regions with high connectivity with known aggregations either had moderate sanctuary zone (i.e. no take area) protection or none at all. Considering the entire distribution, many of the strongest sites sites of connectivity also had no marine protection at all. Therefore it suggests that while the current marine protected areas does contain areas of known aggregation, some areas of strong settlement, e.g. Yamba, could yield results with increased protection. There was also strong settlement to the regions of Newcastle and Sydney, two regions that have limited protection for both settlement and spawning sites (although a marine reserve in the Hawkesbury area is under consideration).

[EDITED UP TO]

The results from Chapter 5 reveal the intricacies in designing marine protected areas and how the desire to protect the maximum amount of species (e.g. increasing biodiversity) does not necessarily provide maximum functionality for all species. There are many factors that drive marine network design including: the amount of fishing pressure species are under [both recreational and commercial @botsford2009], the contiguity of reserve networks based on the connectivity of species to within the system [@botsford2001], and the size of area to protect based on the migration of adult species [@green2015]. Ideally marine reserves should be areas of high local retention [@botsford2009] and also contain enough quality habitat for species to maximise carrying capacity [@cabral2016]. The difficulty arises when species have different traits, e.g. connectivity patterns, adult movements, and habitat requirements. Connectivity is dynamic, as seen by the inter-annual variability in Chapter 5, and designing marine parks using dynamic systems is not a trivial task [@cudney-bueno2009]. In particular for the derived black cod connectivity in Chapter 5, the effects of a southward moving EAC [@ridgway2007] on larval connectivity patterns is unknown. Changing currents is not limited to Australia either, with other systems showing weakening of boundary currents [@thornalley2018].

To address this variability and move away from single species protection, dynamic protected areas and whole of ecosystem approaches have been proposed [@soria2014] to deal with this fundamental variability in marine systems and have been implemented to some degree in Australia in oceanic areas to reduce fishing pressure on pelagic species [@smith2007; @melbourne-thomas2017]. Dynamic protected areas provide benefits not just to species with range-shifts, but provide more even distributions of biomass to improve resilience [@game2009]. Management complexity can be reduced by managing for connectivity, especially if self-recruitment is high [@bode2016a]. Another related solution is to model general traits or multiple species to design marine networks [@treml2012a; @melia2016]. Managing meta-community dynamics is a complex task, and novel techniques will have to be determined [@grainger2016]. Before these approaches can be taken however, more knowledge of the populations biology and connectivity of key targeted species for NSW is required [@curley2013]. Australia is in an enviable position for enacting meaningful conservation, with the ability to legislate for protection over the range of entire populations due to our geography. In this study we only looked at New South Wales and the offshore islands, but the edges of *E. daemelii* distribution range into Queensland and Victoria. Therefore it is important multilateral mechanisms within government [e.g. @anzecctaskforceonmarineprotectedareas1999], provide leadership on enacting conservation strategies that act over species distributions (and potential range shifts) and not dictated by state and federal boundaries.

## Limitations

#### Model validation

The primary question facing an modelling study is to do with the veracity of the model and how confident can researchers be in interpreting and acting upon the modelled results. It is a considerable limitation of this thesis is that there has been no validation of the BDM used in Chapter 3 and 4. Confidence in the model output stems from the validation of the used hydrodynamic model [@oke2013] and knowing it provides accurate current velocities for the model domain compared to other models [@vasile2018]. The development of the biological model utilised a rigorous development process, including unit and sensitivity testing. Model validation for BDM studies commonly use a multi-methodological approach, using genetic [@feutry2013; @sunday2014; @coscia2012; @munguia-vega2014; @crandall2012; @galindo2010] or elemental markers [i.e. otolith chemistry, @crochelet2013] to compare the derived connectivity patterns against observed distributions. These multi-methodological approaches do provide increased confidence in the predicted larval dispersal, but do not (and for practical reasons cannot) capture the temporal and spatial variability. Comparisons with empirical studies that also contain levels of uncertainty, which reduced the power of a direct comparison unless this is accounted for, e.g. through the use of confidence intervals on the results [@nolasco2018]. Model validation using recent recruitment data has only been performed in a small number of studies, even though it has been used successfully e.g. measuring recruitment with light traps explained 70% of the temporal variation predicted by a BDM [@sponaugle2012]. For rare species, such as *E. daemelii* modelled in Chapter 5, validation using recruitment data is difficult, a priori model validation using species with known recruitment data is an alternative approach.

An important next step would be to validate the dispersal patterns of a fish species with known recruitment data for years with corresponding hydrodynamic data. Model validation would also tell us about the ability of the hydrodynamic models, specifically predictive ability of the low resolution near the coastal settlement sites and how realistic the given settlement buffer is. Chapter 2 suggested that model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics, it is more reasonable to suggest this will depending on the coastal dynamics. While for rare species like the black cod it is hard to use recruitment data to validate the results, if confidence in the model can be obtained using well studied species it is a desired results. Accepting that fact assumptions about empirical data will always exist for reef fish, at least in the short-term, and balancing it up that it is important to included larval behavioural traits, an important step is to try and understand the effect of these assumptions, which I tried to somewhat address in Chapter 4 by testing the effects of different OVM strategies.

### Physical model limitations

Hydrodynamic models will always contain a degree of error and uncertainty in their predictions [@fossette2012] and the size of the error in measurements is not consistent between models [@nolasco2018]. This study used off-line hydrodynamic models, which allow for faster computation than in-line (running physical and biological models simultaneously). However, using off-line hydrodynamic models decreases the model resolution (e.g. increases the model time step) and uses interpolation to estimate some of these processes that occur on shorter time-scales. The hydrodynamic model used in this thesis had a 24-hour time step and therefore short lived dynamic processes (e.g. tidal movements) are not captured as well. The ability of models to accurately predict current velocities over small spatial scales, e.g. near coastal areas, is also a potential limitation as these small-scale local dynamics are important in recruitment dynamics [CITE]. Chapter 2 suggested that model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics, its more reasonable to suggest this will depend on the regional coastal dynamics, e.g. the strong settlement effects of small scale sticky reef dynamics are not captured on the scale of many hydrodynamic models [@golbuu2012]. The mapping of small scale regional dynamics also relates to similar questions about the mapping of small scale settlement habitat and the resolution of both should be in step.

### Biological model limitations

[assumptions of empirical data]

For the biological model, the limitations introduced are related to the number of assumptions made during its design. These assumptions range from how to implement larval behaviours to the choice of values to parameterise these behaviours.

For Chapter 5, I had to use assumptions for unknown specific *E. daemelii* parameters, using related species or family data. The requirement to use assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority of BDM studies due to the lack of empirical information.



The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

An important next step would be to validate the dispersal patterns of a fish species with known recruitment data for years with corresponding hydrodynamic data. Model validation would also tell us about the ability of the hydrodynamic models, specifically predictive ability of the low resolution near the coastal settlement sites and how realistic the given settlement buffer is. Chapter 2 suggested that model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics, it is more reasonable to suggest this will depending on the coastal dynamics. While for rare species like the black cod it is hard to use recruitment data to validate the results, if confidence in the model can be obtained using well studied species it is a desired results. Accepting that fact assumptions about empirical data will always exist for reef fish, at least in the short-term, and balancing it up that it is important to included larval behavioural traits, an important step is to try and understand the effect of these assumptions, which I tried to somewhat address in Chapter 4 by testing the effects of different OVM strategies.

The most notable limitation of this biophysical dispersal modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

## Future research

### Models and reproducibility

A trait common to nearly all biophysical connectivity studies is that they are attempting to estimate at least one of two fundamental and general patterns; 1) levels of connectivity between natal and settlement sites and 2) dispersal of particles in the system. The first is essentially a measure of larval source-sink dynamics, looking at patterns of production and settlement in marine species with a pelagic larval phase that inherently links one patch in the system to another. The second is a measure of the total dispersal area, looking at issues such as how far larvae disperse and where they occur in highest densities in the system. Both traits are useful in describing system connectivity and dispersal and are a product of the system and modelling environment. In undertaking the review in Chapter 2, I came across two impediments to a meta-analysis of these estimated metrics. Firstly, many studies utilised their own unique metric in measuring either of these patterns. In fact, I found over 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of connectivity & dispersal Secondly, for a given metric, often only a single summary statistic was reported, e.g. mean, median, or upper quartile. Summary statistic are useful, however they were often reported without information on the underlying dispersal distribution, making rigorous qualitative comparisons difficult.

Reproducibility, a term often synonymous with open science, is an important facet in assessing the scientific merit of a published paper [@opensciencecollaboration2015]. It can be difficult to achieve in ecological studies due to the inherent variability in nature [@schnitzer2016], however, the same challenges do not exist in computational modelling [@peng2011]. Ideally for reproducibility, the model configurations, source code and the output data is made available at the time of publishing. Transparency provides both confidence to the reader, and importantly the peer reviewer, about the outcome and interpretations of the study [@sudhof2016]. Utilising common frameworks for designing, coding, and testing BDMs, e.g. TRACE [@grimm2014], is another important step to produce realistic and reliable models.

@sandve2013 produced ten rules of reproducibility for computational research, which all apply to studies involving a biophysical model. Most are intuitive, such as tracking exactly how results were obtained, automating as many steps as possible, and using version control for scripts, code & software. Others are not thought about as often, like recording the seed used for random number generators, which was not seen amongst the connectivity studies. The most visible facet to a researcher reading a published study is Rule 10; "all input data, scripts, versions, parameters, and intermediate results should be made publicly and easily accessible" [@sandve2013]. Ignoring the reporting of the random number seed and providing access to source code, only 34% of the studies in our review could be considered reproducible.

Transparency is difficult when performing complex modelling because of all the parameters used. In our review, there were many common and rectifiable omissions that prevented reproducibility, deduced while inspecting the methods and the supporting information (if available). 12% of the studies did not mention the years used for their oceanographic model in their simulation. 34% did not mention the time-step used when advecting the particles in their model. 69% mentioned using diffusion in their model, but only 51% of these published the diffusion coefficient used. When mortality was implemented into the biophysical model, 25% of these studies either did not include the mortality curve or rate used. It is advised, where possible, to use oceanographic models that are freely available to the public. Fortunately, this is happening more, whether it is government funded ocean models becoming available through legislative requirements or studies using open hydrodynamics models such as the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) or the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), which can be coupled with higher resolution models for specific site locations. Transparency amongst models (providing source code) allows for other researchers without the necessary coding skills to utilise the system. There are several examples of this already [e.g. Ichthyop [@lett2008], CMS [@paris2013], MGET @roberts2010], suggesting popular support for model reuse amongst the community.

Complexity in biophysical models derives from coupling two distinct models, biological and physical, creating an additive effect on the number of input parameters. However, it is impossible to reproduce a biophysical connectivity study without all of these parameters, hence the importance of publishing these parameters along with the results. The strong trend towards supplementary information [@kenyon2014] in journals allows for publication of these parameters without obscuring the primary scientific message. The cost of reproducible research for biophysical studies is minimal, many free online repositories exist for both source code and data, two popular examples being GitHub (http://github.com) and Dryad (http://datadryad.org). Only two studies in the review uploaded their data using such a portal, both choosing to use Dryad. Several journals are also making reproducibility a requirement and providing mechanisms for online storage of data (e.g. PLOS Biology).

#### A common approach

In order to provide transparency and allow for useful comparisons between connectivity studies using biophysical models, a common approach to publishing both methods and results is required. Two main problems with connectivity studies were identified that prevented meaningful comparisons. The first is a lack of commonality to the metrics used to describe the connectivity amongst studies. The second issue is the lack of reproducibility and clarity of the model parameters used in studies.

To get consistency amongst metrics, the suggested approach is to utilise the two most common metrics currently reported. These provide useful measures and also they should be readily accepted amongst the research community (@tbl:metrics). The first metric, a connectivity matrix (also referred to as a transition matrix), is the most useful for connectivity studies. The connectivity measures of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success can all be calculated from the underlying matrix data (means of these values are also useful in publication for easy reference). Therefore, in addition to presenting the data in a heat map visualisation, the full connectivity matrix should be published. It is suggested these are published in an online data-repository or attached as supplementary information, rather than in the body of the paper. This is especially important where studies may have simulated a number of connectivity matrices for different situations (e.g. time periods, parameter combinations). The supplied matrices can be data summaries, e.g. supplying the mean connectivity matrix (with estimates of variation) for a study conducted over a five year period. It is understood reporting of connectivity matrices can become non-trivial depending on the number of sites used in the model and the number of days larvae are spawned. There is no one solution, instead options ranging from complete data dumps, to summarising results into more management segments (e.g. years), or even only providing data relating to the important findings of the paper.  However, if you vary a parameter such as PLD, different matrices should be supplied for each value used value used in order for such results to be more broadly useful to the field in the future. Graph theory is also a useful technique to assess the connectivity of a system. There are easily derived and comparable metrics, however, it can be hard to calculate the underlying values of the connectivity matrix, which makes it hard to compare against studies that do not also use a graph theory approach. So even where graph theory has been utilised, publishing the basic connectivity matrix is still important.

: The two metrics that are required to make comparative analysis from studies using biophysical connectivity models. From each of these metrics, four important measures can be derived for further analysis {#tbl:metrics}

| Published metric    | Derivable measure parameters  |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------|
| Connectivity matrix | Site-site connectivity values |
|                     | Self-recruitment              |
|                     | Local retention               |
|                     | Dispersal success             |
| Dispersal kernel    | Mean distance travelled       |
|                     | Median distance travelled     |
|                     | Maximum distance travelled    |
|                     | Measure of spread             |

The second most important metric used to describe the output of these models is the dispersal kernel. The dispersal kernel——a probability density function——gives information about the spread and distance of dispersed the particles in the system. For the dispersal kernel, a publishing the density plot, along with a heat map, is the recommendation. From a density plot we can derive the mean, median and maximum distance travelled to allow for comparisons between studies, along with the distribution of the dispersal kernel. Note that when we talk about distance, we are referring to actual distance travelled, therefore when other distances such as straight-line or alongshore distances are used it is important to define this. There is no consensus for a measure used for spread. A few of studies in our review used a measure called positive or seeded area, which counted all the cells in the system that had greater than one particle to get a measure of spread. Another two studies tried to calculate the centre of the mass of particles to see how it changed over time. The positive area measure holds potential though it would need to be standardised to the size of the cells used in the model.

To provide transparency between studies on how the biophysical model is implemented, we have provided a non-exhaustive list of the sort of parameters required to reproduce these studies (@tbl:open). The list covers parameters used for both the physical and biological models. This is not definitive, models will increasingly become more complex and there will be more parameters added to the initialisation of the models. For reproducibility purposes, an individual set of parameter values should be supplied for every model run used in the study. Again, these can be supplied in the supporting information or online in a data repository.

In order to advance our understanding of connectivity in marine systems, biophysical modelling studies need to start publishing consistent quantitative metrics of dispersal and connectivity so that comparisons can be made. Studies must also provide more transparency on the parameters used. We have attempted to provide a template for the basic information we think necessary based on our review. We suggest this template be used as the basis for discussion amongst scientists in the field, but strongly encourage all researches publishing the results of biophysical connectivity studies to adopt at least the principles of cohesion, consistency and transparency which are at its core. We feel that such an approach will greatly speed advancements in our understanding of the drivers and outcomes of connectivity more generally. Ultimately it is confidence in the generality of the results of these models which, along with more empirical validation of the modelled output, will allow for their more widespread use within management and conservation initiatives.

### Empirical research questions

Ocean acidification.. more species...

The reasons for vertical migration. Lots of wild speculation, but no concrete evidence. For example why are some species Scorpaenidae downward migrators and some upwards? What drives the different patterns ? predator avoidance, prey choices, schooling?

### BDM studies

The ability of BDM model

Connectivity is THE tool at the moment due to the difficulties faced with empirical studies [CITE].

Advanced computing increases the options of connectivity modelling

Future research refining the method of OHS used is another area of research, including other factors known to influence the swimming ability of larval fish such as temperature [CITE] and viscosity (i.e. including the Reynolds number, CITE).

### Ocean acidification

A caveat to this thesis is the adverse role of ocean acidification on the sensory ability of ichthyoplankton, which has the potential limit larval dispersal to only passive transport [@leis2018]. Preliminary research into some species of ichthyoplankton has shown ocean acidification interferes with senses such as hearing [@rossi2016], vision [@allan2014], and chemosensation [@sundin2017; @ferrari2011], which would impair the ability of fish to orientate towards habitat cues. Therefore even if swimming ability is not affected by increased CO~2~ in the ocean, undirected horizontal swimming is essentially passive transport with increased randomness, i.e. stronger turbulence.
