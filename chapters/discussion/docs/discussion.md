Thesis aims and summary
-----------

Understanding the connectivity of marine species and the contributing processes are important questions for marine ecology.

The theme of this thesis was to contribute to the understanding of the processes that influence the dispersal and connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton. Using a meta-analysis of recent studies, an empirical study of larval fish ontogenetic vertical distribution, a theoretical modelling approach, and finally using an applied modelling approach I have been able to give new insights into the connectivity of reef fish populations. The results of this thesis have implications for biophysical connectivity modelling studies, and the conservation and management of the black cod *Epinephelus daemelii*.

I give an outline of the research summaries of this thesis, addressing similarities, differences, and  implications for connectivity studies

the significance of the results. Then I address the important implications for the future directions of biophysical dispersal modelling, and for connectivity studies in general.

## Trends in biophysical dispersal modelling and the influence of these choices on connectivity

Meta-analysis
- How can we report metrics better?
- What can we do with these choice?

Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) is a useful, but complex tool to measure connectivity. Coupling two models, a physical and biological model, creates an influx of parameters, and therefore decisions on the values to use and uncertainty on the effect on the modelled result. Therefore to better understand the trends in of parameter decisions and their influence on connectivity, in Chapter 2 I undertook a meta-analysis of connectivity papers since 2009, when an ICES manual was published detailing a recommended approach [@north2009]. The first aim of the chapter was to identify the trend of parameters used in BDMs. The physical models were becoming more complex, using hydrodynamic models with higher spatial resolution and even nesting hydrodynamic models to ensure the most realistic model for a spatial area was utilise for accuracy. This is especially important for near-shore spatial contexts. The biological models were also found to be more complex over time, suggesting that as we understand more about the early-life history of ichthyoplankton, modellers are feeling confident about using this information in their models. Although it can be argued that the uptake is slow, many BDMS still only use passive larvae, even though it has been accepted amongst ichthyologists that larval fish behaviour can influence dispersal for many years [@leis2007b; @north2009].

The second aim addressed the influences of these parameters, using identified common metrics of connectivity between the papers. There was huge variation seen amongst the metrics, highlighting the differences in connectivity between regions and the effect of combinations of input parameters, i.e. the size of settlement sites, the spatial resolution of the models, the settlement buffer, and the behaviours implemented. Comparisons between studies is inherently difficult because of the differences in models choices, based on principles such as study regions, species, or available knowledge. This complexity makes it difficult to understand the influence of parameter choice and therefore how much confidence in model output we can have. This difficulty is magnified when there is no consensus amongst BMDs for either the choices of parameters used in modelling or the connectivity metrics used to describe the results.

Ontogenetic vertical distributions are not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, but the general pattern for these seven families was to increase depth with age. When ichthyoplankton do exhibit patterns that could be associated with ontogenetic vertical migration, variables of length and stage-abundance can show contrasting patterns because of the large influence of the relative abundance of different stages. Nevertheless, much of this variability can be put down to the difficulty in sampling individual larvae across all ontogenetic stage groups. Even when vertical patterns are seen, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also effect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.




## The influence of larval behaviours, behavioural strategies and processes for ichthyoplankton off the coast of New South Wales


- OHS strong

## Larval dispersal of the black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) and the conservation management implications

The optimum amount of coastline to protect black cod populations can be measured by the fishing pressure faced, both recreational and commercial [@botsford2009]. Its also understood that for sedentary species with larvae that can disperse long distances, such as the black cod, contiguous MPAs can be more effective when comprising coastline twice the dispersal distance [@botsford2001]. However, in contrast the size of the protected coastline for protecting adult black cod can be small, due to its limited movement as an adult [@green2015]. For a population to persist, local retention is important, therefore creating MPAs within regions that exhibit high local retention is crucial [@botsford2009], Although, some simulation studies have shown protecting quality habitat areas (i.e. carrying capacity) for rock cod is more important than preserving sites of connectivity [@cabral2016].

The most notable limitation of this biophysical dispersal modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

## Implications for connectivity: data gaps & generalities

### Meta-analysis

Chapter 2 demonstrated that while the trend in biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) is to investigate reef fish connectivity implementing behaviour, there are still many studies researching connectivity using passive larvae. This is surprising given that it has been known for over a decade that reef fish larvae can influence their dispersal though vertical migration [@paris2004a], or through sensory abilities [@gerlach2007a], and it is generally accepted that reef fish become nektonic before they settle [@leis2006].

###  Empirical data.

## Vertical distribution of reef fish off the coast of New South Wales

Chapter 3 aimed to measure the vertical distribution of reef fish off the coast of NSW, to see if there were any distributional patterns across depths with ontogeny or length. Across the measures, ontogenetic shifts in the distribution were found across the seven reef associated families. The general pattern was to increase with age and length as the centre of mass moved downwards. The exception to this rule was Mullidae, where the centre of mass moved upwards towards the surface.

- talk about the lack of behaviour - why so many passive? chapter 3 shows differences in vertical distribution between fish families. Chapter 4 shows that implementing behaviour connectivity patterns

To address knowledge gaps in the ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour of larval fish off the New South Wales coast, Chapter 3 measured the vertical distribution of seven fish families. The ontogenetic stage and length of the larval fish were measured at three different depth bins from the surface down to a depth of 100 m. The experimental methodology used cannot capture the actual behaviour of the fish, but it does give an estimate of where the centre of mass is for each ontogenetic stage. I found that in general the larval fish moved downwards with ontogeny, seen in other studies.

----
- We've seen similar general patterns
- Doesn't always happen as we saw
- Families vertical migration might be an issue too - due to the variation within families, but very difficult to capture enough of the right species of fish.

----
- If get pattern wrong, what is the effect? (Refer to Chapter 4)
- Not much perhaps. Just need get the correct direction - where the biggest differences are. The effect if including OVM is greater than the effect of different strategies of OVM.

### Chapter 4

- Chapter 4 aimed to see what were the influences of different behaviours / strategies / modelling choices on BDM models using a near shore boundary current system like NSW (or in more general settings)

OHS paragraph
----
- OHS found to be huge!!
- Orientated horizontal swimming was a behaviour that was implemented sporadically in Chapter 2
----

Vertical migration paragraph
- OVM was found to affect patterns
- OVM was found to be a downwards shift for most species (although some different results, which has also been seen across studies)

Modelling processes
- Looked at a bit in chapter 2 (explain different methods seen)
- There was a large effect, need to test sensitivity of models to processes and not just parameters.
- Examples, spawning depth (seen), spawning time, pld (fixed vs random), OHS implementation (the three different kinds).


Sticky reefs not captured on this scale, which have been shown to be important for settlement [@golbuu2012]



### Limitations and future directions.

An important limitation to note of this thesis is that there was not attempted validation of the model using empirical data. This is particularly important for Chapter 4, where I am giving management advice. The most common validation technique is to use genetic markers [@feutry2013; @sunday2014; @coscia2012; @munguia-vega2014; @crandall2012; @galindo2010] or elemental markers [i.e. otolith chemistry, @crochelet2013] to compare the observed structure of distributions with the connectivity patterns. these multidisciplinary approaches do provide some validation of the predicted larval dispersal, but to not capture the temporal and spatial variability. It has also been argued comparisons across two models with differing levels of uncertainty can be fraught, although solutions to this have been sought [@nolasco2018]. Limited validation of models using recent recruitment data has been done, some studies have compared using lights traps - which explained 70% of the temporal variation seen in the model [@sponaugle2012]. An important next step would be to validate the dispersal patterns of a fish species with known recruitment data for years with corresponding hydrodynamic data. Model validation would also tell us about the ability of the hydrodynamic models, specifically predictive ability of the low resolution near the coastal settlement sites and how realistic the given settlement buffer is. Chapter 2 suggested that model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics, it is more reasonable to suggest this will depending on the coastal dynamics While for rare species like the black cod it is hard to use recruitment data to validate the results, if confidence in the model can be obtained using well studied species it is a desired results. Accepting that fact assumptions about empirical data will always exist for reef fish, at least in the short-term, and balancing it up that it is important to included larval behavioural traits, an important step is to try and understand the effect of these assumptions, which I tried to partly address in Chapter 4 by testing the effects of different OVM strategies.

#### Modelling directions
- adding more biology (buoyancy using salinity [@sundby2015])

[assumptions of empirical data]
[coarseness of the hydrodynamic model]

The most notable limitation of this biophysical dispersal modelling approach is the assumptions made for biology of *E. daemelii*, whether using values from related species or averages across species. The need for these assumptions is not specific to this study and occurs in the majority connectivity study with a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). The biggest assumption made for this study was giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary. From Chapter 4, it has been shown this ability for larval fish to orientate significantly changes dispersal patterns. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat is why I chose to make these assumptions [@leis2010]. Another potential limitation is the coarseness of the oceanographic model used, while Chapter 2 suggested model resolution had no effect on connectivity metrics overall, it could influence the final settlement habitats reached; therefore I used settlement regions instead of specific habitat patches. This model coarseness also creates a limitation in not effectively capturing nearshore processes. Validating the results of BDMs are increasingly achievable using empirical methods and an essential next step [@burgess2014]. However, this has to be combined with more knowledge of the early-life history of *E. daemelii* to accurately parametrise model input with behaviour, and knowledge of larval production to produce realised connectivity patterns. The model included constant larval production across all regions and across all years, which is unrealistic in nature.

Error and uncertainty will exist with ocean models [@fossette2012].

### collecting empirical data
- using laboritory techniques [@martinez-quintana2014]



## Conclusion

In conclusion, we believe in order for this field to progress further, we need to better understand the relative importance of different behaviours of connectivity for ichthyoplankton and other marine families (potentially species/taxa specific). This understanding will us to generate baseline models for connectivity and highlight areas of knowledge gaps in early-life history that need to be addressed so we can confidently parametrise these BDMs and generate better outcomes.

OHS DISCUSSION
--------------



OHS - did not account for variations in temperature waters - perhaps temeprature should be a factor in the equation. Tropical fish are known to be better swimmers than teperatre fish etc....

Another future idea is to implement a Reynolds number (can account for the viscosity between tropical and temperate waters)

Shown OHS is an important factor, making issues of ocean acidification, which can remove ability to sense an even greater issue [@rossi2016], and could possibly render this finding useless [@leis2018].

#### MPA connectivity

It has been known that we need to address this variability of connectivity patterns [@cudney-bueno2009]

What species? Benthic, pelagic, etc.. Complexity abounds.

Dispersal relies on egg production and developmental size and time [@burgess2015]

Australia is in an enviable position with the ability to legislate for protection over the range of entire populations due to our geography, although there is still negotiation required between states and also federal governments depending on the jurisdiction. In this study we only looked at New South Wales, but the black cod also do have populations in Queensland and Victoria, with their own marine protected area rules and regulations and to counter range shift states will need to come up with multilateral mechanisms to protect species such as the black cod, i.e. [@anzecctaskforceonmarineprotectedareas1999].

Much needed information is missing on key harvested species in NSW, let alone conservation priorities like black cod [@curley2013].
Knowledge of the population biology, life- history ecology and scales of pre and post-settlement movement of marine species are needed to inform effective conservation management strategies,

The ability to protect variable changes in connectivity is a difficult question. (Triage)

Dynamic protected areas can even out the distribution of the biomass [@game2009], but also create management difficulties (increase management complexity). Although the complexity managing for larval dispersal can be less than managing for other environmental variables, especially if self-recruitment is high [@bode2016a]

Advanced computing increases the options of connectivity modelling [@mumby2017]

Traits that help conservation with a long latitudinal range (positive), but is thought not to move much as an adult (negative) [@sunday2015]

Modelling multiple species to inform conservation management [@treml2012a].

Black cod has protection from fishing, e.g. Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) [@georgeson2014]

Include - publishing or making available results of sensitivity studies, e.g. [@simons2013]. These are of interest to the community!

Variation in habitat quality can produce differences in metapopulation dynamics in terrestrial systems, similar connotations can occur in marine [@fernandez2016]

Mortality is complicated [@johnson2015] (Put in theoretical chapter perhaps)

DVM increases the spread of larvae [@ospina-alvarez2012]

Reproducibility in ecology is inherently hard due to variation [@schnitzer2016]

Trend towards supplementary material [@kenyon2014]

Metacommunities provide for ecosystem diversity, which might require novel empirical techniques to be developed [@grainger2016]
(In metacommunities, species-specific dispersal rates influence the order in which individuals arrive at a local patch, and, through priority effects, this order of arrival can alter coexistence and diversity. The relationship between dispersal rates and priority effects is therefore a potentially important, but largely unexplored, mechanism through which dispersal can alter metacommunity diversity.)

Expected dispersal patterns (and coastal connectivity) show strong dependencies on particle-release location, season and year, reflecting annual and interannual circulation patterns in the SCB [@mitarai2009].



## Implications for biophysical dispersal modelling - how to move forward

A trait common to nearly all biophysical connectivity studies is that they are attempting to estimate at least one of two fundamental and general patterns; 1) levels of connectivity between natal and settlement sites and 2) dispersal of particles in the system. The first is essentially a measure of larval source-sink dynamics, looking at patterns of production and settlement in marine species with a pelagic larval phase that inherently links one patch in the system to another. The second is a measure of the total dispersal area, looking at issues such as how far the particles travel and where they occur in highest densities in the system. Both traits are useful in describing system connectivity and dispersal and are a product of the system and modelling environment. In undertaking the review in Chapter 2, I came across two impediments to a meta-analysis of these estimated metrics. Firstly, many studies utilised their own unique metric in measuring either of these patterns. In fact, we found over 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of connectivity & dispersal Secondly, for a given metric, often only a single summary statistic was reported, e.g. mean, median, or upper quartile. Summary statistic are useful, however they were often reported without information on the underlying dispersal distribution, making rigorous qualitative comparisons difficult.

### Models and reproducibility

Reproducibility, a term often synonymous with open science, is an important facet in assessing the scientific merit of a published paper. It can be difficult to achieve in large empirical studies due to experimental variance [@opensciencecollaboration2015], however, the same challenges do not exist in computational modelling [@peng2011]. Ideally for reproducibility, the model configurations, source code and the output data is made available at the time of publishing. Transparency provides both confidence to the reader, and importantly the peer reviewer, about the outcome and interpretations of the study [@sudhof2016]. Utilising common frameworks for designing, coding, and testing BDMs, e.g. TRACE [@grimm2014], is another important step to produce realistic and reliable models.

@sandve2013 produced ten rules of reproducibility for computational research, which all apply to studies involving a biophysical model. Most are intuitive, such as tracking exactly how results were obtained, automating as many steps as possible, and using version control for scripts, code & software. Others are not thought about as often, like recording the seed used for random number generators, which was not seen amongst the connectivity studies. The most visible facet to a researcher reading a published study is Rule 10; "all input data, scripts, versions, parameters, and intermediate results should be made publicly and easily accessible" [@sandve2013]. Ignoring the reporting of the random number seed and providing access to source code, only 34% of the studies in our review could be considered reproducible.

Transparency is difficult when performing complex modelling because of all the parameters used. In our review, there were many common and rectifiable omissions that prevented reproducibility, deduced while inspecting the methods and the supporting information (if available). 12% of the studies did not mention the years used for their oceanographic model in their simulation. 34% did not mention the time-step used when advecting the particles in their model. 69% mentioned using diffusion in their model, but only 51% of these published the diffusion coefficient used. When mortality was implemented into the biophysical model, 25% of these studies either did not include the mortality curve or rate used. It is advised, where possible, to use oceanographic models that are freely available to the public. Fortunately, this is happening more, whether it is government funded ocean models becoming available through legislative requirements or studies using open hydrodynamics models such as the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) or the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), which can be coupled with higher resolution models for specific site locations. Transparency amongst models (providing source code) allows for other researchers without the necessary coding skills to utilise the system. There are several examples of this already [e.g. Ichthyop [@lett2008], CMS [@paris2013], MGET @roberts2010], suggesting popular support for model reuse amongst the community.

Complexity in biophysical models derives from coupling two distinct models, biological and physical, creating an additive effect on the number of input parameters. However, it is impossible to reproduce a biophysical connectivity study without all of these parameters, hence the importance of publishing these parameters along with the results. The strong trend towards supplementary information in journals allows for publication of these parameters without obscuring the primary scientific message. The cost of reproducible research for biophysical studies is minimal, many free online repositories exist for both source code and data, two popular examples being GitHub (http://github.com) and Dryad (http://datadryad.org). Only two studies in the review uploaded their data using such a portal, both choosing to use Dryad. Several journals are also making reproducibility a requirement and providing mechanisms for online storage of data (e.g. PLOS Biology).

### A common approach

In order to provide transparency and allow for useful comparisons between connectivity studies using biophysical models, we need a common approach to publishing both methods and results. We identified two main problems in the literature with connectivity studies preventing us from making meaningful comparisons. The first is a lack of commonality of metrics used to describe the connectivity amongst studies. The second issue is the lack of reproducibility and clarity of the model parameters used in studies.

To get consistency amongst metrics, our suggested approach is to utilise the two most common metrics currently reported. These provide useful measures and also they should be readily accepted amongst the research community (@tbl:metrics). The first metric, a connectivity matrix (also referred to as a transition matrix), is the most useful for connectivity studies. The connectivity measures of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success can all be calculated from the underlying matrix data (means of these values are also useful in publication for easy reference). Therefore, in addition to presenting the data in a heat map visualisation, the full connectivity matrix should be published. It is suggested these are published in an online data-repository or attached as supplementary information, rather than in the body of the paper. This is especially important where studies may have simulated a number of connectivity matrices for different situations (e.g. time periods, parameter combinations). The supplied matrices can be the summary of your data, e.g. if your study was conducted over a five year period, the matrix can be the mean connectivity over this period. It is understood reporting of connectivity matrices can become non-trivial depending on the number of sites used in the model and the number of days larvae are spawned. There is no one solution, instead options ranging from complete data dumps, to summarising results into more management segments (e.g. years), or even only providing data relating to the important findings of the paper.  However, if you vary a parameter such as PLD, different matrices should be supplied for each value used value used in order for such results to be more broadly useful to the field in the future. Graph theory is also a useful technique to assess the connectivity of a system. There are easily derived and comparable metrics, however, it can be hard to calculate the underlying values of the connectivity matrix, which makes it hard to compare against studies that do not also use a graph theory approach. So even where graph theory has been utilised, publishing the basic connectivity matrix is still important.

: The two metrics that are required to make comparative analysis from studies using biophysical connectivity models. From each of these metrics, four important measures can be derived for further analysis {#tbl:metrics}

| Published metric    | Derivable measure parameters    |
| :------------------ | :-----------------            |
| Connectivity matrix | Site-site connectivity values |
|                     | Self-recruitment              |
|                     | Local retention               |
|                     | Dispersal success             |
| Dispersal kernel    | Mean distance travelled       |
|                     | Median distance travelled     |
|                     | Maximum distance travelled    |
|                     | Measure of spread             |

The second most important metric used to describe the output of these models is the dispersal kernel. The dispersal kernel——a probability density function——gives information about the spread and distance of dispersed the particles in the system. For the dispersal kernel, a publishing the density plot, along with a heat map, is the recommendation. From a density plot we can derive the mean, median and maximum distance travelled to allow for comparisons between studies, along with the distribution of the dispersal kernel. Note that when we talk about distance, we are referring to actual distance travelled, therefore when other distances such as straight-line or alongshore distances are used it is important to define this. There is no consensus for a measure used for spread. A few of studies in our review used a measure called positive or seeded area, which counted all the cells in the system that had greater than one particle to get a measure of spread. Another two studies tried to calculate the centre of the mass of particles to see how it changed over time. The positive area measure holds potential though it would need to be standardised to the size of the cells used in the model.

To provide transparency between studies on how the biophysical model is implemented, we have provided a non-exhaustive list of the sort of parameters required to reproduce these studies (@tbl:open). The list covers parameters used for both the physical and biological models. This is not definitive, models will increasingly become more complex and there will be more parameters added to the initialisation of the models. For reproducibility purposes, an individual set of parameter values should be supplied for every model run used in the study. Again, these can be supplied in the supporting information or online in a data repository.

In order to advance our understanding of connectivity in marine systems, biophysical modelling studies need to start publishing consistent quantitative metrics of dispersal and connectivity so that comparisons can be made. Studies must also provide more transparency on the parameters used. We have attempted to provide a template for the basic information we think necessary based on our review. We suggest this template be used as the basis for discussion amongst scientists in the field, but strongly encourage all researches publishing the results of biophysical connectivity studies to adopt at least the principles of cohesion, consistency and transparency which are at its core. We feel that such an approach will greatly speed advancements in our understanding of the drivers and outcomes of connectivity more generally. Ultimately it is confidence in the generality of the results of these models which, along with more empirical validation of the modelled output, will allow for their more widespread use within management and conservation initiatives.
