General discussion
=================

The overarching aim of this thesis was to contribute to the understanding of the biological traits and behaviours that influence the dispersal and connectivity patterns of larval fish. Assuming that the models developed here provide realistic reproductions of larval dispersal, I have been able to give new insights into the connectivity of larval fish using a combination of meta-analysis of recent biophysical dispersal model (BDM) studies, an empirical study on the ontogenetic vertical distribution of larval fish, a theoretical modelling study investigating the influence of larval fish behaviours on connectivity, and finally predicting the connectivity of the reef fish *Epinephelus daemelii* and evaluating the potential effectiveness of marine reserves. The results of this thesis have implications for both the considerations of future BDM studies and the conservation and management of *E. daemelii*. This discussion chapter integrates the key findings of this thesis, providing summations of each data chapter and addresses similarities, differences, and implications for the field. In addition, the limitations of BDM studies are addressed, and directions and recommendations for future research are explored.

## Summary of key findings

Biophysical dispersal models are a useful tool to [Minor3601]{.comment-start id="3601" author="Reviewer 3"}estimate[]{.comment-end id="3601"} larval fish connectivity in the absence of readily obtained empirical results, however, these models are necessarily complex because so many variables contribute to dispersal outcomes. BDMs are becoming more prevalent and sophisticated as computing power increases and at the same time becomes more economical [@mumby2017]. The complexity of BDMs arises from coupling physical and biological models together, creating an influx of modelling parameters and choices — each with consequences for the degree of uncertainty in BDMs. To minimise this uncertainty, one approach is to use applicable model choices (i.e. generalities) from prior BDM studies in the literature. Therefore, to understand the trends of parameter choices (and their influence on predicted connectivity), I undertook a meta-analysis of BDM connectivity studies in Chapter 2. The meta-analysis used studies published from 2009 onwards, the publication year of the ICES manual detailing a standard approach for BDMs studies [@north2009]. The first aim of the chapter was to identify the trends of parameters included in BDMs for both the physical and biological models. The physical models are becoming more complex, using hydrodynamic models with increasing spatial resolution and nesting regional hydrodynamic models to capture spatial oceanography accurately, e.g. different hydrodynamic models capturing either near-shore or off-shore processes. Similar to the physical models, biological models are increasing in complexity with researchers encapsulating more behaviour in models over time, most likely correlated with increased knowledge of larval fish life history. However, there was still a strong tendency to use passive transport models — a surprising result given that it has been known for over a decade that reef fish larvae can influence their dispersal through vertical migration [@paris2004; @werner1993], or through sensory abilities [@gerlach2007], and it is generally accepted that reef fish become nektonic before they settle [@leis2006]. [Minor1711]{.comment-start id="1711" author="Reviewer 1"}Of the three step progression for connectivity models in the ICES manual [@north2009], Step 1: the minimum model (passive particles with spawning movement) was implemented the most (37.9%); Step 2: biological features (e.g. vertical movement behaviour and mortality) was implemented in 56.7% of models, and the final phase Step 3: small-scale features was only implemented in 5.4% of the studies. While it appears encouraging that a large percentage of the models were Step 2 using biological traits, it must be noted that 55.7% of those models were passive larvae with only a mortality function applied, and there are few empirical estimates of mortality rates for marine larvae.[]{.comment-end id="1711"}.

The second aim of the meta-analysis was to examine the influence of these parameters on commonly identified metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance) of connectivity amongst the studies. Considerable variation was seen amongst the reported values for each of the metrics. This result highlights the differences in connectivity patterns both across regions and the effect parameter choice has on input parameters. The extensive suite of input parameters reduced the ability to perform analysis across all combinations. Moreover, transparent reporting of all included parameters and subsequent values did not always occur and there was no consensus on connectivity metrics. Comparisons between studies are inherently difficult because of the differences in each model's choices, based on principles such as study regions, species, or available knowledge. Despite these difficulties, I was able to derive several patterns regarding the influence of model choices on connectivity metrics. Firstly, in an open oceanic system the dispersal distance of larval fish was longer and there was a decrease in local retention. The hydrodynamic model resolution did not affect the metrics of predicted connectivity, but using nested hydrodynamic models did result in less self-recruitment. Of the biological parameters investigated, the length of both the pelagic larval duration (PLD) and settlement competency window had no influence on the metrics. Including larval mortality in a BDM did not impact the settlement success to the extent expected. Settlement success was increased by the inclusion of any behaviour, while orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) specifically decreased self-recruitment, which was an unexpected result. To progress this field further, there is a need to decide upon common metrics that allow meaningful comparisons between models, which is addressed below. [Minor 1601]{.comment-start id="1601" author="Reviewer 1"}There is also a need for researchers to include more complex small scale behaviour that can influence dispersal in their models. In @north2009, three phases of model development were identified, the first phase has no behaviour (37.7% of models), the second phase has some behavioural traits (56.8% of models), and the third phase of models with behaviour affecting small scale processes only 3.4% of models.[]{.comment-end id="1601"} This review provides researchers with more context on what parameters are important to include in future BDM studies.

As mentioned within this thesis, a major challenge of using BDMs to predict connectivity is the scarcity of species-specific information on fish early-life history and on post-settlement but pre-recruitment effects. Modellers are often compelled to introduce assumptions in parameter choice for larval behaviours, i.e. by using values of [Minor3602]{.comment-start id="3602" author="Reviewer 3"}congeners or confamilials[]{.comment-end id="3602"} [see methods in Chapter 5; @young2012], or general values [see methods in Chapter 5; @corell2012]. If there is no information for a particular parameter choice, another option for modellers to limit uncertainty is to exclude specific behaviours from the BDM, even if the behaviour is known to strongly influence connectivity [@andrello2013]. [Minor3603]{.comment-start id="3603" author="Reviewer 3"}Although this approach arguably ignores the reality of processes involved in dispersal and therefore produces predictions that could be tenuous.[]{.comment-end id="3603"} Therefore, connectivity modelling requires the modeller to consider the inclusion of realistic biological processes against limiting the assumptions needed to parameterise these processes, [Minor3604]{.comment-start id="3604" author="Reviewer 3"}noting that not modelling certain processes is also an assumption of realism.[]{.comment-end id="3604"} [Minor1602]{.comment-start id="1602" author="Reviewer 1"}Another important modelling requisite is to understand the sensitivity of dispersal patterns to biological parameters within a complex model, allowing researchers to understand what values are ecologically relevant.[]{.comment-end id="1602"}Reducing these modelling assumptions is primarily addressed by collecting more data on larval fish.

Ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) is a behaviour of larval fish known to influence dispersal by exposing larvae to currents with variable strengths and directions across the water column [@cowen2009]. To date, OVM has not been explicitly studied for reef-associated larval fish of NSW. To address this knowledge gap and with the goal of using the data to parameterise a BDM, Chapter 3 measured the OVM distribution of seven reef-associated taxonomic families of fish off the coast of NSW. The ontogenetic stage (preflexion, flexion, and postflexion) and standard length of the larval fish were measured at three different depth bins; 0-5 m, 5-50 m, and 50-100 m. In addition, I also investigated any differences in these patterns between water masses, i.e. coastal or eddy waters. The experimental methodology, a common technique [@barnett1984; @paris2004; @irisson2010], does not explicitly capture OVM behaviour, but it does give a robust estimate of where the centre of mass is for each larval fish ontogenetic stage. Visual observation of OVM behaviour of larval fish in nature is limited to small spatial (e.g. upper 20m of water column) and temporal scales (e.g. minutes to hours), requiring other methods to assess vertical distribution [@leis2010].

In general, the larval fish were found to migrate deeper with ontogeny and length, [Minor3605]{.comment-start id="3605" author="Reviewer 3"}expected due to the high correlation between these traits.[]{.comment-end id="3605"} This pattern has been seen in other studies looking at the vertical distribution of reef fish [@irisson2010; @huebert2011]. Mullidae was the exception to this pattern, migrating upwards towards the surface waters with ontogeny, corresponding to where postflexion Mullidae larvae have been found off NSW [@gray1993]. The type of water mass did not affect the vertical distribution of the larval fish, [Minor3606]{.comment-start id="3606" author="Reviewer 3"}suggesting that other factors such as biological traits (e.g. metabolic constraints), predator-prey and resource allocation processes, or environmental conditions determine vertical migration behaviour[]{.comment-end id="3606"} [@lampert1989; @wurtsbaugh1988; @fouzai2015]. [Minor3607]{.comment-start id="3607" author="Reviewer 3"}Older and longer larvae were found within eddies as expected, principally due to eddies entraining and entrapping larval fish near spawning areas and then moving off the shelf, and also the potential of eddy enrichment providing for growth[]{.comment-end id="3607"} [@lobel1986; @mullaney2013; @shulzitski2016].

Vertical distribution patterns of larval fish are known to be highly variable both within and between species. Therefore, the results are often contrasting, e.g. in Chapter 3 I found a strong ontogenetic shift downwards for Scorpaenidae, yet other studies have found Scorpaenidae had either no ontogenetic movement [@huebert2011] or found postflexion larvae at the surface [@kuwahara1983]. [Minor1603]{.comment-start id="1603" author="Reviewer 1"}One explanation could be the interactions between the different behaviours affect vertical position (OVM, DVM, and OHS) hide the underlying patterns of each behaviour.[]{.comment-end id="1603"} The discrepancies seen could be differences between species within a taxonomic grouping, as studies often group larval fish into taxonomic families (as seen in Chapter 3) due to the expert level knowledge required to use morphological diagnostics to identify larval fish to species. Species identification of larval fish is predicted to become less of an issue as genetic techniques such as DNA barcoding for larval fish mature and become cheaper for researchers to access [@hubert2015]. Differences in species at geographic locations or can also drive the variation in results as larval fish are known to behave differently in tropical or temperate environments, i.e. latitudinal differences [@figueira2009a; @leis2013]. [Minor1604]{.comment-start id="1604" author="Reviewer 1"}The date of sampling could also be another driver[]{.comment-end id="1604"} of the observed variation in vertical distribution, as it could be influenced by the structure and temperature of the water column, which undergoes seasonal changes [@malcolm2011]. Inherent differences between species across spatial and temporal scales are one concern, but there is also the difficulty of ensuring equal sampling efforts across ontogenetic stages and depths due to net avoidance of postflexion fish [@leis2006], high mortality rates [@houde1989; @houde1989a; @white2014; @johnson2015], and general patchiness in distributions [@gray1993; @cowen1993]. Deriving general patterns for OVM for larval fish might therefore be impossible, with comparisons focused on studies with similar latitudes.

With the knowledge that behaviours of larval fish affect dispersal and connectivity patterns [@leis2007], Chapter 4 endeavoured to investigate the relative influence of behaviours on connectivity using a BDM. The aim was achieved twofold, through examining the effect of combinations of different larval fish behaviours, and by changing both the parameter values and implementation methodology of a specific behaviour. The larval fish behaviours were parameterised using a combination of values derived from the literature and the OVM results obtained in Chapter 3. The behaviours used in this chapter chosen were: OVM [@paris2004], DVM [diel vertical migration; @aiken2011], and OHS [@staaterman2012]. Including behaviour in this model increased local retention and reduced the dispersal distance, confirming similar results in other studies [@shanks2009; @paris2007]. However, this pattern is not universal amongst studies as sometimes the opposite effect is seen, e.g. including behaviour can increase dispersal [@ospina-alvarez2012]. It was found that movement behaviour strongly influenced connectivity patterns, however, the choice of location and timing of larval release had an even stronger effect, due to the geographical differences in oceanography.

Amongst the different behaviours considered, the one most influential on connectivity was OHS, with the least influential being OVM. Other studies have found similar results for the strong effect of OHS, with the behaviour reducing dispersal distance and increasing local retention [@wolanski2014; @staaterman2012]. [Minor1605]{.comment-start id="1605" author="Reviewer 1"}However, this result will be sensitive to the modelled implementation of OHS[]{.comment-end id="1605"} due to the ability of larval fish to swim at speeds greater than the prevailing current [@fisher2005]. So far there is no consensus on how to model the process of swimming for larval fish in a BDM [@willis2011]. Some approaches have periods where the fish cannot swim until a period of time passes [often the mid-point of the PLD; @smith2009; @abesamis2016], while other implementations such as ours, incrementally increase the fishes' swimming ability with age [@wolanski2014]. Unlike the approach taken in our model, many studies also do not provide a random component to the swimming ability and therefore all larvae in the model swim at the same parameterised speed. Once the larval fish have developed swimming abilities, it is often assumed that they swim constantly, except for one study using a similar approach to ours, which allowed the fish larvae to swim for a portion of each time step [@huebert2009]. One considerable limitation of our modelled OHS (and an area for future research) is that we did not include the Reynolds number when estimating the swimming speed [i.e. turbulent processes; @armsworth2001; @fisher2000] that could limit the swimming ability of larval fish when combined with temperature effects [@fuiman1997; @herbing2002] and the considered energetic choice between swimming and drifting for late stage larval fish [@derekhogan2005]. A wide range of swimming speeds were implemented across the BDMs, ranging from 0.001 ms^-1^ [@porch1998] to upper values at 0.45 ms^-1^ [@wolanski2014], although similarly wide ranges have also been reported amongst observed swimming speeds for larval fish [@leis1997].

Despite this observed influence of OHS, only a small number of the reviewed studies in Chapter 2 included it in their models, either perhaps because OHS was not thought to be as influential as it was seen to be in Chapter 4, or due to insufficient data on the particular study species. Orientation behaviour of larval fish is a relatively recent field of interest, yet these results suggest that including OHS behaviour in future connectivity studies should be a priority. The influence of OHS on connectivity patterns emphasise the importance of future research into the sensory abilities of larval fish (e.g. hearing, vision, and chemosensation) and understanding how they discern habitat and settlement cues [@faillettaz2015; @berenshtein2014; @leis2014]. The swimming abilities of larval fish, however, are one of the more well-studied facets of their early-life history [@fisher2000; @hogan2007; @leis1997; @stobutzki1997], therefore fewer assumptions are required in model parameterisation — [Minor3609]{.comment-start id="3609" author="Reviewer 3"}introducing a behaviour into a model will require more assumptions, hopefully with less impact on the modelled output[]{.comment-end id="3609"}. [Minor1606]{.comment-start id="1606" author="Reviewer 1"}Although swimming behaviours are used[]{.comment-end id="1606"} for other well established processes other than dispersal, i.e. escaping predators and capturing prey [@paradis1996; @job2000; @houde2008], and omitting these other processes from a model limits the achievable realism of the directed swimming.

Differences in connectivity patterns derived from the seven different ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns found in Chapter 3 were minimal. The sensitivity of the dispersal patterns increased when the ontogenetic vertical distribution remained constant but the timing of vertical movement for individual larva between depths was varied (i.e. difference implementations of the process). This result, [Minor3610]{.comment-start id="3610" author="Reviewer 3"}acknowledging it is region specific or at most can be broadly applied to other western boundary currents[]{.comment-end id="3610"}, leads to the conclusion that accurately modelling the processes of a specific behaviour is more important than precision about the parameterisation of the behaviour. From these results, it can also be inferred that for OVM behaviour in a BDM, using assumptions to parametrise the behaviour could be a better modelling choice than not including the behaviour at all. Chapter 4 accentuates the importance of sensitivity analyses in BDM studies and how researchers should aspire to publish or make the results of sensitivity analyses available [@simons2013].

The final chapter of this thesis, Chapter 5, took an applied BDM direction, building upon the results of each of the previous data chapters. The central aim was to predict the larval connectivity patterns of the black cod [*E. daemelii*; @francis2016], a protected species of New South Wales (NSW). The BDM used for the study included the larval fish behaviours of OHS and OVM, based on the influence on connectivity patterns in the region seen in Chapter 4. Parameterisation of the OVM behaviour used the Serranidae vertical distribution results obtained in Chapter 3. *E. daemelii* larvae were released over the period 2004-2011 across its entire known distribution along the NSW coastline and the offshore islands, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs and Lord Howe Island. The larval dispersal of *E. daemelii* was assessed to determine the connectivity of 19 regions within the distribution, specifically identifying regions of strong source and settlement, i.e. both consistent and relatively high settlement over the entire release period. Despite being protected since 1983 [enacted due to sharp population decline in the 20th century @francis2016], *E. daemelii* abundance has not increased. One potential explanation for this population stasis is that the protection framework, i.e. the marine reserve network of NSW, is not designed for *E. daemelii* connectivity. Therefore, the second aim of the chapter was to compare these modelled connectivity patterns, using both the entire distribution and considering only known regions of aggregation, to ascertain if there are gaps within the existing marine protected network and if so, what regions should be prioritised for protection.

Despite the near-shore boundary current along the NSW coastline, e.g. the Eastern Australian Current (EAC), the strongest predicted connectivity of *E. daemelii* larvae occurred either at the natal region or to the proximate regions. Some level of dispersal occurred between the majority of regions across the known distribution, providing predicted potential genetic connectivity, with dispersal tailing in a polewards direction (i.e. the direction of the EAC). Connectivity had been hypothesised to occur between the NSW coastline and the off-shore islands [@appleyard2007] and weak connectivity was seen between the northern and southern regions of NSW. Four connected subpopulations were identified using graph theory: a northern, central, southern population along the NSW coastline, and an off-shore reef population. Within these subpopulations, robust demographic connectivity was predicted to occur, but importantly there was connectivity between the four subpopulations. Comparisons of the potential connectivity with the current marine protected area network of NSW found that regions strongly connected to other regions with known aggregations either had moderate sanctuary zone coverage (i.e. no-take areas) or none at all. Considering the entire distribution, many of the strongest sites of connectivity had no marine protection within the region. Therefore, these results suggest that while the current marine protected areas do contain the patches of known aggregation, there are regions with strong predicted settlement where increased protection could yield conservation benefits, e.g. Yamba. There was also strong predicted settlement to the regions of Newcastle and Sydney, two regions that have limited protection for both settlement and spawning sites [a marine reserve in the Hawkesbury Shelf bioregion, encompassing the regions Newcastle, Sydney, and Wollongong, is under active consideration; @nswgovernment2018].

The results from Chapter 5 reveal the intricacies of designing marine protected areas and how the desire to protect the maximum amount of species (e.g. increasing biodiversity) does not necessarily benefit all targeted species. Marine reserves need to be constantly evaluated to ensure their protection goals are being met [@watson2016; @agardy2016]. There are several factors that drive marine network design, e.g. the amount of fishing pressure species are under [both recreational and commercial @botsford2009], how contiguous the network of reserves needs to be using species connectivity patterns [@botsford2001], and deciding the size of the protected area relative to the migration of adults [@green2015]. Ideally, marine reserves should be areas of high local retention [@botsford2009], and contain enough quality habitat for species to maximise carrying capacity [@cabral2016]. Connectivity itself is a dynamic process, with changes in oceanography and biology affecting larval dispersal as demonstrated by the inter-annual variability seen in Chapter 5. Some adult populations are highly mobile [@welsh2014], which could produce variation between spawning locations. Therefore designing MPAs using patterns of larval connectivity is not a trivial task [@cudney-bueno2009] as dispersal profiles seen in one year might not occur the following year. For example, the effects of a southward moving EAC [@ridgway2007] on the modelled black cod connectivity patterns in Chapter 5 is unknown. The phenomenon of changing currents is not limited to Australia either, with other major oceanic systems showing a weakening of boundary currents [@thornalley2018]. However, management complexity can be reduced by managing for larval connectivity, especially if the self-recruitment and local retention of a species are high [@bode2016a].

The difficulty in designing marine protected areas arises due to species having variable traits, e.g. connectivity patterns, movement of adult populations, and habitat requirements. To deal with this issue, a triage approach can be taken, either prioritising the protection of certain assets [e.g. species or habitat; @bottrill2008] or ecosystem services [@pendleton2015]. This approach to conservation is not without controversy as it raises many ethical questions about deciding which species will go extinct [@wilson2016]. However, the threat of climate change is creating an atmosphere where researchers are more willing to take interventionist approaches [@hagerman2014]. Other approaches are to identify the critical subpopulations and linkages within a metapopulation to target for protection [@watson2011; @artzy-randrup2010] or connectivity surrogates when connectivity is unknown [@bode2012]. A recent proposed solution to address the variability of connectivity is to use dynamic protected areas or a whole-ecosystem approach [@soria2014]. Dynamic protection attempts to deal with the fundamental variability and openness of marine systems, an environment that is distinct to terrestrial systems and therefore requires different approaches [@carr2003]. Dynamic protected areas provide benefits to species undergoing range-shifts, and produce an even distribution of biomass to improve the resilience of species to a changing environment [@game2009]. This dynamic approach has been implemented to some degree in Australia in oceanic areas to reduce fishing pressure on pelagic species [@smith2007; @melbourne-thomas2017]. Designing MPAs with a metacommunity approach [@leibold2004] can overcome this variability by using the connectivity patterns modelled from general larval traits or using multiple species across taxonomic groups [e.g. coral, crabs, and fish; @treml2012a; @melia2016]. Managing metacommunity dynamics is a complex system, e.g. changes in primary productivity can drive variation in community dynamics [@fernandez2016], and novel techniques are still being developed to measure these dynamics to benefit marine spatial planning [@grainger2016; @melia2016]. This complexity suggests a community-wide range-shift due to changing conditions is unlikely; most likely, species within a community will exhibit different responses, complicating future conservation management [@yletyinen2016].

Before these approaches can be fully utilised in NSW, more knowledge of the population biology and connectivity of vulnerable and commercially important species (including *E. daemelii*) is required [@curley2013]. Australia is in an enviable position to enact meaningful conservation because of the ability to legislate for marine protection over the entire distribution ranges of many temperate species. The primary impediment is the different jurisdictions between states and the Commonwealth. In this study, I only looked at source regions within NSW and the offshore islands, but the edges of the distribution range of *E. daemelii* occur in Queensland and Victoria. Therefore, multilateral mechanisms between governments must exist [e.g. @anzecctaskforceonmarineprotectedareas1999], providing both a framework and tools for enacting conservation strategies that act over species distributions and potential range-shifts, instead of being dictated by arbitrary state and federal boundaries.

## Limitations to biophysical dispersal modelling for measuring connectivity

Hydrodynamic models will always contain a degree of error and uncertainty in their predictions [@fossette2012] and the size of this uncertainty is not consistent between models [@nolasco2018], therefore this error is structural in BDM studies. Off-line hydrodynamic models were used in Chapter 4 and 5 as they allow for faster computation than in-line models (running physical and biological models simultaneously). [Minor1607]{.comment-start id="1607" author="Reviewer 1"}However, using off-line hydrodynamic models can decrease the model precision depending on the size o the time step of resolution (increased time steps reduce data storage), therefore requiring interpolation to estimate current velocities at intermediate times.[]{.comment-end id="1607"} The hydrodynamic model used in this thesis had a 24-hour time step and therefore short-lived dynamic processes (e.g. tidal movements) are not captured in the model. Chapter 2 suggested that model resolution did not affect connectivity metrics, however, it is likely this depends on the regional coastal dynamics, e.g. the strong settlement effects of small-scale sticky reef dynamics are not captured on the scale of many [Minor1608]{.comment-start id="1608" author="Reviewer 1"}large-scale hydrodynamic models [@golbuu2012], which are often required to ask ecologically relevant questions.[]{.comment-end id="1608"}

As mentioned above, assumptions of modelling choices made during the design of BDM studies can be a significant limitation to interpretation of the results. Decisions on assumptions are required about which biological traits and behaviours to include, and the subsequent values with which to parameterise them. Mortality rates of larval fish are a prime example of an almost universal assumption included in BDM studies, as for many species the exact rate of larval mortality is estimated from indirect sources [@johnson2015]. In Chapter 5, specific data on the timing of development for *E. daemelii* was unavailable, therefore I assumed a similar species within the subfamily Epinephelinae would be representative. This approach is not unreasonable, but it must be acknowledged it is an assumption nonetheless, [Minor3612]{.comment-start id="3612" author="Reviewer 3"}amplified due to the empirical experiments using laboratory reared larvae [@cunha2013] that may not mimic the timings of development seen in the wild.[]{.comment-end id="3612"} Another assumption in Chapter 5 was the size of the settlement sensory distance used, giving the larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards suitable habitat within a 7 km boundary based on studies seen in Chapter 2. The likelihood of *E. daemelii* larvae being able to sense habitat over considerable distance is the reason these assumptions were made [@leis2010; @paris2013], however, the exact distance and ability are not explicitly known. Future research needs to concentrate on understanding OHS for larval fish, and many novel techniques are being designed to achieve this goal [@paris2013; @mouritsen2013; @berenshtein2014]. [Minor3613]{.comment-start id="3613" author="Reviewer 3"}In the short-term, accepting more assumptions will be required (with the goal of reducing the number and scope of assumptions over time), and understanding the consequences of these assumptions is an important research topic.[]{.comment-end id="3613"} In Chapter 4, I addressed this by testing for both the effects of parameter choice (different distributions throughout ontogeny for vertical migration) and the effects of different implementations of modelling behaviour (changing the distribution with ontogeny, daily, or with the time step).

## Model validation

The predominant question for BDM studies concern the veracity of the model and therefore the level of confidence in interpreting the results. It is a limitation of this thesis that the BDM used in Chapters 4 and 5 has not been validated against empirical data. Partial confidence in the dispersal patterns arises from validation of the hydrodynamic model used [@oke2013], which has been shown to provide accurate current velocities for the model domain when compared to other geographically relevant hydrodynamic models [@vasile2018; @chiswell2014]. [Minor1609]{.comment-start id="1709" author="Reviewer 1"}However, the absence of realistic coastal dynamics modelling is still a cause for concern. Validating the results of BDMs is increasingly achievable using empirical methods (if the scale of the ecological study and the physical model correlate)[]{.comment-end id="1709"} and an essential next step of the research [@burgess2014]. Model validation for BDM studies commonly use a multi-methodological approach with genetic [@feutry2013; @sunday2014; @coscia2012; @munguia-vega2014; @crandall2012; @galindo2010] or elemental markers [i.e. otolith chemistry; @crochelet2013] to compare the derived connectivity patterns against observed distributions. These multi-methodological approaches provide increased confidence in the predicted larval dispersal but do not (and for practical reasons, cannot) capture temporal and spatial variability. Empirical studies contain their own levels of uncertainty, therefore the power of a direct comparison is reduced unless this uncertainty is accounted for, e.g. by using confidence intervals [@nolasco2018]. Model validation using known recruitment data has been performed in a handful of BDM studies, i.e. measuring recruitment with light traps explained 70% of the temporal variation predicted by a BDM [[Minor1610]{.comment-start id="1710" author="Reviewer 1"}@domingues2012[]{.comment-end id="1710"}; @sponaugle2012]. For rare species, such as *E. daemelii* modelled in Chapter 5, validation using recruitment data is difficult, and so utilising a priori model validation with known recruitment data for another species is an alternative approach.

## Reproducibility and transparency

A trait common to nearly all biophysical connectivity studies is that they are attempting to estimate at least one of two fundamental and general patterns: the levels of connectivity between natal and settlement sites and the dispersal of larvae in the system. The former is mostly a measure of larval source-sink dynamics, looking at patterns of production and settlement in marine species with a pelagic larval phase that inherently links one patch in the system to another. The latter is a measure of the total dispersal area, looking at issues such as how far larvae disperse and where they occur in highest densities in the system. Both traits are useful in describing system connectivity and dispersal and are a product of the system and modelling environment. In undertaking the review in Chapter 2, I came across two impediments to a meta-analysis of these estimated metrics. Firstly, many studies utilised unique metrics to measure either of these patterns. In fact, I found over 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of connectivity & dispersal. Secondly, for a given metric, often only a single summary statistic was reported, e.g. mean, median, or upper quartile. Summary statistics are useful, however, they were frequently reported without information on the underlying dispersal distribution, making rigorous qualitative comparisons difficult.

Reproducibility, a term often synonymous with open science, is an important facet in assessing the scientific merit of a published paper [@opensciencecollaboration2015; @allison2016]. It can be difficult to achieve in ecological studies due to the inherent variability in nature [@schnitzer2016]. However, the same challenges do not exist in computational modelling [@peng2011]. Ideally, for reproducibility the model configurations, source code, and the output data are made available along with the publication. Transparency provides confidence to the reader and importantly the peer reviewer in the outcomes and interpretations of the study [@sudhof2016]. Utilising common frameworks for designing, coding, and testing BDMs [e.g. TRACE; @grimm2014] and automating workflows [@wilson2014] are important steps to produce realistic and reliable models.

@sandve2013 produced ten rules of reproducibility for computational research, which all apply to studies involving a biophysical model. Most are intuitive, for example, tracking precisely how results were obtained, automating as many steps as possible, and using version control for scripts, code, and software. Others are not thought about as often, such as documenting the seed used for random number generators, which was not seen amongst the connectivity studies in Chapter 2. The most visible facet to a researcher reading a published study is Rule 10 of @sandve2013: "all input data, scripts, versions, parameters, and intermediate results should be made publicly and easily accessible". Ignoring the reporting of the random number seed and providing access to source code, only 34% of the studies in our review could be considered reproducible from the information made public.

Transparency is difficult to obtain for complex modelling studies, due to a large number of parameters and modelling choices involved. In my review, many common and rectifiable omissions prevented reproducibility, deduced while inspecting the methods and the supporting information (if available). 12% of the studies did not indicate the years used for their oceanographic model in their simulation. 34% did not mention the time step used when advecting the larvae in their model. 69% cited using diffusion in their model, but only 51% of these published the diffusion coefficient used. When mortality was implemented into the biophysical model, 25% of these studies did not include the mortality curve or rate used. It is advised, where possible, to use oceanographic models that are freely available to the public (although preference should be towards the most accurate model). This is fortunately becoming more common, whether it is government funded ocean models becoming available through legislative requirements or studies using open hydrodynamics models such as the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) or the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), which can be coupled with higher resolution models for specific site locations. Transparency amongst models (providing source code) allows other researchers without the necessary coding skills to utilise the system. There are several examples of BDMs already following an open source paradigm [e.g. Ichthyop @lett2008; CMS @paris2013; MGET @roberts2010], suggesting widespread support for the reuse of models in the community.

Complexity in biophysical models derives from coupling two distinct models, biological and physical, creating an additive effect on the number of input parameters. However, it is impossible to reproduce a biophysical connectivity study without all of these parameters, hence the importance of publishing these parameters along with the results. The strong trend towards supplementary information [@kenyon2014; @pop2015] in journals allow for publication of these parameters without obscuring the primary scientific message. The cost of reproducible research for biophysical studies is minimal as many free online repositories exist for both source code and data, two popular examples being GitHub (http://github.com - used for this thesis) and Dryad (http://datadryad.org). Only two studies in the review uploaded their data using such a portal, both choosing to use Dryad. Several journals are also making reproducibility a requirement and providing mechanisms for online storage of data (e.g. PLOS Biology).

### A common approach

To provide transparency and allow for useful comparisons between connectivity studies using biophysical models, a common approach to publishing both methods and results is required. Two main problems with connectivity studies were identified that prevented meaningful comparisons. The first is a lack of commonality to the metrics used to describe the connectivity amongst studies. The second issue is the lack of reproducibility and clarity of the model parameters used in studies.

The suggested approach to achieve consistency between metrics is to utilise the two most common metrics currently reported. These provide useful measures and also they should be readily accepted amongst the research community (@tbl:metrics). The first metric, a connectivity matrix (also referred to as a transition matrix), is the most useful for connectivity studies. The connectivity measures of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success can all be calculated from the underlying matrix data (means of these values are also useful in publication for easy reference). Therefore, in addition to presenting the data in a heat map visualisation, the full connectivity matrix should be published. It is suggested these are published in an online data-repository or attached as supplementary information, rather than in the body of the paper. Publishing this data is especially important where studies may have simulated many connectivity matrices for different situations (e.g. time periods, parameter combinations). The supplied matrices can be data summaries, e.g. providing the mean connectivity matrix (with estimates of variation) for a study conducted over a five year period.

It is understood that the reporting of connectivity matrices can become non-trivial depending on the number of sites used in the model and the number of days larvae are spawned. There is no one solution, but instead a range of options from providing complete data dumps to summarising results into more manageable segments (e.g. years), or only providing data relating to the important findings of the paper. However, where a parameter such as PLD is varied, different matrices should be supplied for each value used for such results to be more broadly useful to the field in the future. Graph theory is also a useful technique to assess the connectivity of a system [@treml2008]. There are easily derived and comparable metrics, however, it can be hard to calculate the underlying values of the connectivity matrix, which makes it hard to compare against studies that do not also use a graph theory approach. So even where graph theory has been utilised, publishing the fundamental connectivity matrix is still essential.

: The two metrics that are required to make a comparative analysis of studies using biophysical connectivity models. From each of these metrics, four important measures can be derived for further analysis {#tbl:metrics}

| Published metric    | Derivable measure parameters  |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------|
| Connectivity matrix | Site-site connectivity values |
|                     | Self-recruitment              |
|                     | Local retention               |
|                     | Dispersal success             |
| Dispersal kernel    | Mean distance travelled       |
|                     | Median distance travelled     |
|                     | Maximum distance travelled    |
|                     | Measure of spread             |

\
The second most important metric used to describe the output of these models is the dispersal kernel. The dispersal kernel——a probability density function——gives information about the spread and distance of dispersed larvae in the system. For the dispersal kernel, publishing the density plot and a heat map is the recommendation. From a density plot, the mean, median and maximum distance travelled can be derived to allow for comparisons between studies, along with the distribution of the dispersal kernel. Note that distance refers to the actual distance travelled, therefore when other distances such as straight-line or alongshore distances are used it is important that they are specified. There is no consensus for a measure used for spread. A few studies in our review used a measure called positive or seeded area, which counted all the cells in the system that had greater than one particle to get a measure of the spread. Another two studies tried to calculate the centre of the mass of larvae to see how it changed over time. The positive area measure holds potential though it would need to be standardised to the size of the cells used in the model.

To provide transparency between studies on how the biophysical model is implemented, a non-exhaustive list of the sort of parameters required to reproduce these studies is provided (@tbl:open). The list covers parameters used for both the physical and biological models. This list is not definitive as models will increasingly become more complex and there will be more parameters added to the initialisation of the models. For reproducibility purposes, an individual set of parameter values should be supplied for every model run used in the study. Again, these can be supplied in the supporting information or online in a data repository.

To advance our understanding of connectivity in marine systems, biophysical modelling studies need to start publishing consistent quantitative metrics of dispersal and connectivity so that comparisons can be made. Studies must also be more transparent about the parameters used. The template provides the basic information seen to be necessary based on the review in Chapter 2. This template should be used as the basis for discussion amongst scientists in the field, but I actively encourage all researchers publishing the results of biophysical connectivity studies to adopt at least the principles of cohesion, consistency and transparency which are at its core. Such an approach will greatly speed advancements in our understanding of the drivers and outcomes of connectivity more generally. Ultimately, it is confidence in the generality of the results of these models, along with more empirical validation of the modelled output, which will allow for their more widespread use within management and conservation initiatives.

## Future research

There are unanswered questions about the ontogenetic vertical distributions seen in Chapter 3 – do these distributions reflect actual behaviour of larvae, and if they do vertically migrate, why are different patterns seen between families? It has been argued that the patterns observed do not relate to individual behaviour at all and could be a result of differing mortality both between ontogenetic stages and between species [@irisson2010]. As mentioned in Chapter 3, other drivers of vertical distribution could be due to environmental factors [@job2000; @aceves-medina2008; @lougee2002], metabolic factors [@wurtsbaugh1988], feeding strategies [@pearre2003; @llopiz2009], or predator avoidance. These patterns could also be explained as be snapshots in time of diel vertical migration patterns, and not specifically ontogenetic. Our understanding of ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour is still cursory at best; it is known that these patterns exist and they influence dispersal, but why these patterns occur is still up for debate. Due to the influence of vertical migration on connectivity, it is important to understand the processes behind these patterns, and how warming oceans and ocean acidification might effect vertical migration and thus connectivity patterns.

Currently BDMs are the most effective tool to measure connectivity over large-scale spatial and temporal scales, and advances in computing are only making connectivity modelling more realistic of natural processes and more accessible to researchers. The ability to manipulate parameters allows for understanding the influential processes of connectivity, as seen in Chapter 4. The results showed that OHS was the most influential behaviour for regional connectivity, and similar to vertical migration, the exact processes underlying the ability for reef fish to sense settlement habitat is unknown for many species. Suggested processes include sight [@berenshtein2014], sound [@sallares2009], smell [@gerlach2007], magnetic compass [@bottesch2016], or hydrostatic pressure [@huebert2010]. Further research in understanding which processes contribute the most to the ability of larval fish to orient will provide more accurate BDMs with a realistic implementation of OHS behaviour. Other factors that influence swimming should be explored in BDM connectivity studies, such as the effects of temperature and viscosity [@fuiman1997; @herbing2002] on connectivity patterns.

A caveat to some of the conclusions of this thesis is the potential impact of global climate change on the dispersal of marine larvae, specifically warming and acidification [@chan2018]. There is a strong likelihood that ocean acidification will adversely impact the sensory ability of larval fish [@ashur2017], potentially reducing larval dispersal to a passive process and making OHS behaviour redundant for predicting connectivity patterns [@leis2018]. Research has shown that a common neurotransmitter, present in larval fish, is adversely affected at the high CO~2~ levels predicted to occur at the end of the century [@nilsson2012; @nagelkerken2016]. Preliminary research into several species of larval fish has shown ocean acidification interferes with senses such as hearing [@rossi2016], vision [@allan2014], and chemosensation [@sundin2017; @ferrari2011], impairing the ability of fish to orientate towards settlement cues. Therefore, even if swimming ability is not affected by the predicted increased of CO~2~ in the ocean, undirected horizontal swimming is essentially passive transport with increased randomness, i.e. stronger turbulence, and has limited influence on connectivity. As stated in @leis2018, ocean acidification could jettison the biophysical dispersal paradigm, resulting in increased dispersal distance, lower local retention, lower self-recruitment, and lower settlement success.

## Conclusion

This thesis provides guidance on important biological processes for future connectivity studies, particularly for the larval fish dispersal of south-eastern Australia. Future connectivity studies will hopefully utilise this research and include important dispersal influencing behaviours in BDMs, i.e. OHS and vertical migration — I described the ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns for seven families of larval fish that can be used for parameterisation. This outcome, which along with improved reproducibility of BDM studies, should strengthen the accuracy of modelled connectivity patterns. Using this thesis, conservation managers can feasibly use the modelled connectivity patterns of *E. daemelii* to produce more informed decisions for the population recovery of this threatened species, which has been elusive to date.
