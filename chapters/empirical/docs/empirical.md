The vertical migration patterns (ontogenetic and length) of temperate reef-associated ichthyoplankton of New South Wales and the effect of entrainment in cold-core eddies on these patterns.
==================================================================================================================================================================================

Abstract
--------

Ichthyoplankton have been shown to vertically migrate with ontogeny, a behaviour that influences their dispersal through exposing the larvae to currents with different velocities. Most studies have focused on studying the vertical migration of tropical reef fishes, that have been shown in general, to migrate downwards with ontogeny. This chapter aimed to investigate if similar ontogenetic vertical migration patterns also occur for temperate reef fish along the eastern coast of Australia. The vertical distribution was sampled at three depth ranges (0-5 m, 5-50 m, 50-100 m) using MOCNESS and Neuston nets. Sixteen stations were sampled during 2-18 June 2015; eight along the continental shelf, and eight within cold-core eddies. Larval fish were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, their length measured and classified as either preflexion, flexion or postflexion based on their developmental stage. Generalised linear models were used to determine if the ichthyoplankton exhibited patterns of vertical migration with ontogeny and length. Four families (Labridae, Serranidae, Scorpaenidae, and Synodontidae) exhibited a downwards migration with ontogeny, Mullidae migrated upwards with ontogeny, and two families showed no ontogenetic vertical migration (Pomacentridae and Scaridae). The amount of vertical migration varied between taxonomic families. There was no effect of eddy on ontogenetic vertical migration but there for all families except Scaridae, the larvae inside and eddy were longer, suggesting retention. Environmental variables explained only some of the variance, and it was not consistent between taxonomic families. The vertical migration patterns observed, while varying between taxa, provides the ability for ichthyoplankton to influence their dispersal through ontogeny. These results of this study will be useful in parameterising connectivity modelling studies for these temperate reef-associated families.

Introduction
------------

Ichthyoplankton are generally hatched from eggs with a limited behavioural set of capabilities, but with the onset of ontogenetic development they increase their competency to swim, sense and orientate over a short period of time [days to weeks; @leis2006]. Historically, larval dispersal was thought to be driven predominately by ocean currents and the length of pelagic larval duration of the species [@williams1984]. Other effects were considered negligible due to the weak swimming ability of larvae. Subsequent research has found out that behaviour plays a big part in the dispersal of ichthyoplankton. The capability of larval fish to change their vertical position in the water column increases local retention [@paris2007]. Ichthyoplankton can often sustain horizontal swimming speeds higher than the prevailing currents, allowing them to choose their path of dispersal [@leis2006a; @fisher2000]. Furthermore, the larvae of many species can also detect and orientate towards settlement habitat using their senses to detect water chemistry, sound, and visual cues [@kingsford2002; @leis2010]. These factors in combination enable larvae to choose between reefs, i.e. search for higher quality habitat or evince a preference to settle close to the natal reef [@jones2005; @gerlach2007a]. Behavioural traits influencing dispersal are particularly important for many reef fish species with bipartite life histories, a pelagic larval phase and sessile adult phase. The dispersal, and thus connectivity between populations, occurs during its pelagic larval stage.

One commonly observed behavioural trait of fish is the tendency to migrate vertically through the water column. These movement patterns might be in response to their development (ontogenetic vertical migration, OVM) or to daily light/dark cycles (diel vertical migration, DVM). The ability of larvae to regulate their depth from the time of hatching is independent of the ability to sense, orientate, and swim [all behaviours that develop later in life; @leis2010]. The vertical distribution patterns of diel [@lampert1989] and ontogenetic [@gronkjaer1997] vertical migration are well represented in the literature. The evolutionary advantage of vertical migration is believed to be a reduction in mortality due to predator avoidance [especially visual predators in the case of diel vertical migration; @lampert1989]. It has also been hypothesised that vertical migration provides metabolic advantages by allowing ichthyoplankton to change their thermal environment [@wurtsbaugh1988] due to changes in diet with ontogeny [@llopiz2009]. Changing position in the water column allows for indirectly affecting dispersal due to changes in current velocities and directions with depth [@paris2004; @paris2007], either through physical processes such as Ekman transport [@sponaugle2002] or by selective tidal transport in and out of estuaries [@hare2005; @grioche2000]. Turbulent surface waters have also been seen to induce ontogenetic shifts in vertical distribution, with preflexion larvae migrating away from turbulent waters [@hernandez2009]. Changes in ontogeny can cause changes in metabolic needs, and potential new prey can have different vertical distributions [@irisson2010]. Different patterns between taxa can be driven the differences in diets [@llopiz2015].

While it is increasingly acknowledged that vertical migration affects dispersal and population connectivity, general patterns of OVM are not well understood. It has been suggested that the overall biomass of larval reef fish tends to get deeper in the water column with ontogeny [@paris2004; @irisson2010]. Species-specific ontogenetic vertical migration patterns are relatively unknown due to the variation between and within species, and over spatial contexts [@leis2010]. Therefore, localised studies are required to determine the vertical migration patterns of ichthyoplankton. This study focuses on investigating the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval reef fish in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. While there have been many studies on the vertical distribution of larval assemblages off the NSW coast [@dempster1997; @gray2000; @keane2008], changes in vertical distribution with development are less studied. OVM has been investigated for some commercially valuable species off the coast of NSW [@smith2003], along with more general relationships between length and depth, comparing surface to deeper off-shore waters [@gray1993] and DVM patterns between preflexion and postflexion larval fish [@gray1998]. Understanding this early-life history of larval fish is important for parameterising biophysical models since reducing the number of assumptions improves the accuracy of a model [@leis2007b].

The eastern coast of Australia has complex ocean conditions, a rugged coastline with a narrow continental shelf and a strong near-shore boundary current (the East Australian Current, EAC). Previous studies have suggested that over short time periods, passive advection can explain observed dispersal patterns [@smith1999]. However, it is hypothesised that vertical migration behaviour can strongly influence dispersal in the region by assisting larval fish in avoiding the strong EAC surface currents [@paris2007]. The EAC often spawns warm-core and cold-core eddies off the coast of New South Wales at any latitude, though they tend to be concentrated below 32Â°S [@suthers2011; @everett2012]. These mesoscale eddies entrain continental shelf waters, bringing with them both pelagic eggs and newly hatched larval fish and providing nutrient rich environments for them to develop and potentially reducing predation [@shulzitski2015; @mullaney2013; @matis2014; @syahailatua2011]. Simulation studies have shown that eddy speed, fish swimming speed [@chang2017], and the vertical distribution of fish [@condie2016] can influence the retention time within an eddy. Mesoscale cyclonic eddies, with their nutrient rich waters, have increased phytoplankton production [@mcgillicuddy1999; @waite2007], leading to increased zooplankton abundance as an eddy grows older [@govoni2010]. Larval fish will migrate to where the zooplankton are located in the water column [@govoni2010], potentially altering patterns of vertical migration seen in coastal waters. However, to my knowledge, no studies have empirically investigated how eddies affect the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval fish.

In this study, I investigated the vertical distribution of larvae in different oceanographic features (eddy versus no-eddy) off the coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia using depth-stratified plankton tows. It must be noted that the sampling method only infers the vertical distribution and does not inform about the specific behaviour leading to these patterns [@pearre1979]. I aimed to determine the ontogenetic patterns of vertical distribution of temperate reef fish families off NSW (estimated both by fish length and ontogenetic stage), and if the nature of these patterns are dependent on the surrounding oceanography (entrained in an eddy).

Methods
-------

Sampling was undertaken along the eastern coast of Australia aboard the Australian Marine National Facility's RV *Investigator* (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2015_V03). Sixteen stations were sampled across two coastal regions and two cold core eddies (one frontal ~7 days old and one mesoscale ~47 days old) in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC; @fig:stations). The location of the eddies was calculated onboard using real-time data and novel techniques [@roughan2017]. At each station, larval fish were sampled using two different net types, a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) and a Neuston net. Both nets had a 1 m^2^ mouth area and 500 Î¼m mesh. The MOCNESS system sampled over two different depth ranges, 5-50 m and 50-100 m, conducting two 10-minute tows over each depth range. The Neuston net captured larval fish at the near surface level (0-5 m) and was deployed for two 10-minute tows per station. For the rest of this chapter, the depths will be referred to as surface (0-5 m), middle (5-50 m; the thermocline occurred at ~50 m across all stations), and deep (50-100 m). Neuston and MOCNESS nets were deployed at the same time and all tows were conducted between sunset and sunrise to remove any confounding effect of diel vertical migration.

Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, including dissolved oxygen and fluorescence, were recorded for each station using the Seabird SE911 CTD system and Aquatracker fluorometer. Each net had a flow sensor, enabling concentrations of larval fish per cubic metre to be calculated. For each sample pair per station, each sample was preserved in 10% buffered formalin solution. But for one sample per net, larger fish that could be easily identified in the sample by eye were removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 70% ethanol solution in case genetic or otolith analysis was required later on some of the larval fish. In total, 36.4% of the ichthyoplankton was preserved in ethanol, with a slight bias towards postflexion fish (postflexion fish made up 59.0% of the ichthyoplankton preserved in ethanol and only 20.7% of the fish preserved in formalin). The ad hoc selection process for ethanol preservation was used at all stations. Both samples were used in the analyses and no correction for shrinkage was made for the ethanol samples. Therefore the measurements of postflexion larvae could be biased towards under-measurement of length [the exact level of shrinkage is species and even individual specific; @pepin1998], but comparisons were not made across groups and the effect on the results is predicted to be minimal. Total lengths of postflexion larvae preserved in either formalin or ethanol only differed for two families; Labridae (p < 0.001) and Scaridae (p < 0.05). In these cases, the smaller larvae preserved in formalin is likely due to the selection of larger larvae for ethanol preservation.

### Data processing

In the laboratory, each zooplankton sample was sorted to separate out the ichthyoplankton. The samples were rinsed to remove excess formalin and preserved in 70% ethanol solutions. The larval fish were then sorted by morphological features and identified to the family taxonomic level where possible, utilising reference guides and expert help where appropriate [@moser1996; @leis2000; @neira1998]. For the analysis, the most abundant (greater than 100 captured) reef-associated fish families were identified from the samples, which were the family groups: Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. For ichthyoplankton, ontogenetic stages can be broadly defined relative to the developmental hallmark of flexion, marked by the beginning of the development of the caudal fin when the notochord bends upwards and fin rays start to develop. For the analysis, the ichthyoplankton were classified into three categories of ontogenetic stage, i.e. preflexion, flexion, or postflexion (@fig:stages). Each fish was photographed using a calibrated stereo microscope and the standard length (SL) was measured to the nearest Î¼m using the image acquisition software Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Insight Version 8.

### Data analysis

To evaluate the effect of depth and oceanographic feature on OVM patterns, I used general linear models (GLMs) with either length or abundance (concentration) as the response variable (@tbl:glm-models). A separate GLM was constructed for each of the seven families and the two response variables (length and abundance), using the independent factors of feature (levels: eddy or coastal), and depth (levels: surface, middle, deep). The stage-abundance data was analysed with concentration (individuals per 1000 m^3^) as the response variable and using ontogenetic stage (levels: preflexion, flexion, postflexion) as a factor. For visualising the stage-abundance, the depth of the centre of mass for each ontogenetic stage of each family was calculated by weighting the mean depth of an interval by the proportion of larval of each stage which occurred within that interval. Mean temperature (Â°C), salinity (PSI), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and fluorescence (Relative Fluorescence Units), values were calculated for the depth range covered by each net at each station and included in the model to explain variability associated with the specific location of each station within the broader region.

For each family, GLMs were evaluated using a backwards elimination approach. Starting with the full model which included all possible predictor variables, Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection was used to remove non-significant predictors until a model with the maximum significant predictors and lowest possible AIC was identified [@zuur2007]. Reduced models were only considered if they were significantly different from each other using Chi-square tests on residual sum of squares. Dissolved oxygen and fluorescence were highly correlated with each other (r^2^ = 0.73), and therefore only one was included in any model at a time, but both were tested for significance separately (@tbl:glm-models)

Abundance was standardise using concentration (individuals per 1000 m^3^) per filtered volume of water calculated from the flow meter. The stage-abundance data was analysed using a negative binomial distribution to account for the over-dispersion of the data due to the high number of zeros. Despite the large number of zero observations, no models were considered to be zero-inflated after comparing the expected zeros of the data with a negative binomial model and a zero-inflated negative binomial model [@zuur2009]. The larval fish length data was fitted with GLMs using a gamma distribution and log link function to account for the bounded non-normal distribution (possibly due to gear selection and high larval mortality), a common distribution used for fish length data [@pitcher2002]. Patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration were considered to be evident if in the stage-abundance models there was a depth and stage (DxS) interaction, and in the length models, there was an effect of depth (@tbl:glm-models).

For conciseness, only the Wald chi-square analysis of deviance test results are presented. Post-hoc analysis of the GLMs was performed using pairwise tests on the least squares means with a Tukey adjustment. All analyses were conducted using the R programming language [@rcoreteam2017]. The following R packages were used in the analysis; *MASS* was used for negative binomial GLMs [@venables2002], *car* [@fox2011] and *DHARMa* [@hartig2017] were used for model validation, and *lsmeans* [@lenth2016] and *multcomp* [@hothorn2008] were used for GLM post-hoc analysis.

Results
-------

The seven reef-associated families comprised 2827 fish in total, of which 44.3% came from the family Labridae (@tbl:catch-summary). One surface tow at station 8 was not included in the analysis because there were no flowmeter readings to determine concentration, and at station 16 the surface nets were not deployed due to rough conditions. Labridae were the most abundant of the seven families. There were differences in catches of ontogenetic stages, with some families such as Serranidae and Mullidae dominated by small preflexion larvae and Labridae was dominated by larger postflexion larvae (@tbl:catch-summary). Pomacentridae and Scaridae had low samples of postflexion and preflexion respectively. For Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae, and Scorpaenidae, more than 65% of the larvae were sampled from water within an eddy (@tbl:catch-summary). Synodontidae were the longest larvae with a mean of 10.35 mm and Serranidae were the shortest overall at 3.22 mm.

### Ontogenetic vertical migration patterns

For stage-abundance, the most parsimonious model for six of the seven families contained an interaction term between ontogenetic stage and depth, only the model for Scaridae did not have an interaction term (@tbl:results-models). The interaction between ontogenetic stage and depth, suggesting ontogenetic vertical migration, was significant for the families Labridae, Mullidae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae and Synodontidae (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).

In general, most larvae across all ontogenetic stages were captured in the middle and surface layers of the water column (@fig:stage-prop). Preflexion larvae were almost exclusively found in the top 50 m. The only larvae to occur in high proportions in the deep layer, were Serranidae flexion and postflexion larvae, and Scorpaenidae postflexion larvae. Of the five families showing stage-abundance vertical migration, there were three patterns general patterns; migrate downwards with flexion (1), migrate downward with flexion and then upwards with postflexion (2), migrate downwards with flexion and further downwards with postflexion (3; @fig:stage-weight). Pattern (1) was seen in Labridae and Synodontidae larvae, (2) in Mullidae, and (3) in Scorpaenidae and Serranidae. Similar migration was observed in Scaridae and Pomacentridae, patterns (2) and (3) respectively, though the changes in ontogenetic abundance were not significant.

Each reef fish family had depth as a predictor of length (@tbl:results-models), however, it was only a significant predictor for six of the families, with Synodontidae showing no effect (@tbl:length-glm-output). The effect of depth on length exhibited three general patterns; the larvae were shorter in the middle depth and longer at the surface and the deep (1), the larvae increased in length in the deep layer (2), or the larvae were shortest at the surface (3; @fig:length-depth). Pattern (1) was observed for Labridae and Mullidae larvae. Scaridae, Serranidae and Scorpaenidae larvae all displayed pattern (2). Pomacentridae was the only family to display pattern (3). Apart from Synodontidae, where length was not different across the three depths, the larvae were longer on average in the deep layer.

### Does vertical migration change within an Eddy?

Feature (eddy or coastal waters) was not found to change the patterns of vertical migration. For stage-abundance, the only parsimonious model that included the three-way interaction of Feature x Stage x Depth was Pomacentridae, but the interaction was not significant (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). An interaction between Feature x Depth was not included in any of the parsimonious length models (@tbl:results-models). In general, eddies had higher abundances (@fig:conc-feature; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output) and longer ichthyoplankton (@fig:length-feature; @tbl:length-glm-output), than the coastal waters. Although, this was not consistent across all families, with no effect of feature on the concentration of Labridae, Mullidae, and Scaridae, and no effect of feature on the length of Scaridae. Eddies did have different makeups of ontogenetic stages for some families, either entraining older larvae (e.g. Labridae and Scorpaenidae) or in the case of Mullidae, younger larvae. The eddy also had depth effects on larval concentration, increasing the number at the surface waters for Labridae, and decreasing the concentration at the deep layer for Pomacentridae.

### Effect of water characteristics on abundance and length

The thermocline was consistent across stations, occurring at approximately 50 m, below the mixed layer the water was on average two degrees colder and about one degree cooler inside a cyclonic eddy (@fig:env-data A). Temperature was the common predictor of both abundance (significant for five families) and length (significant for four families) of the sampled larval fish, although the direction of the effect was not consistent across families (@tbl:water-summary). The halocline was most variable at the surface inside the eddy, and consistent for the middle and deep depths (@fig:env-data B). Salinity predicted abundance in one family, Scaridae larvae, but predicted the length in three families (negative predictor for Pomacentridae and Scaridae, a positive predictor for Scorpaenidae; @tbl:water-summary). Dissolved oxygen and fluorescence (albeit with more variation), displayed similar patterns, being consistent between the surface, and the intermediate depths, but declining in the deep (@fig:env-data C, D). Both were higher inside the eddy at the surface and middle depths, the effect on Fluorescence was stronger, suggesting more production in the cyclonic eddies the than coastal waters. Dissolved oxygen predicted the abundance of Scaridae (negative) and Serranidae (positive), and only affected the length of Pomacentridae (positive; @tbl:water-summary). In a similar trend, fluorescence was a negative predictor of abundance for Mullidae and Pomacentridae larvae, and only a negative predictor for the length of Labridae.

### Family summaries

#### Labridae

Labridae larvae moved down the water column with flexion, with more flexion and postflexion larvae found below 50 m than preflexion (p < 0.001; @fig:stage-prop). The postflexion larvae were more abundant in the surface waters than flexion larvae. This pattern was reflected in the length model, which had the shortest larvae in the middle depth, and the longest at both the surface and deep depths (@fig:length-depth). Labridae larvae were more abundant in eddies (@fig:conc-feature), and the entrained larvae were on average 1.14 times longer than found in coastal waters (@fig:length-feature). Eddies had increased abundance of Labridae postflexion larvae, but also increased the concentration of larvae at the surface waters when compared to coastal waters (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Temperature was found to have a positive effect on the abundance, but a negative effect on the length of Labridae larvae (@tbl:water-summary). Fluorescence also had a negative effect on Labridae length.

#### Mullidae

Mullidae larvae were most common at the surface and middle depths for all ontogenetic stages. The centre of mass moved downwards from preflexion to flexion (@fig:stage-weight), but upwards from flexion to postflexion (@fig:stage-prop). Postflexion larvae were also found to occur in the deep more than preflexion larvae (p = 0.045). This pattern is supported in part by the length data, with the postflexion larvae in the surface and deep depths driving the patterns of longer lengths at these depths (@fig:length-depth). Overall, Mullidae larvae were more abundant inside eddies (@fig:conc-feature), but this was driven by preflexion larvae that were 15.9 times more abundant (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Flexion and postflexion Mullidae larvae were found in lower numbers in eddies compared to the coastal waters. In contrast, the Mullidae larvae were on average longer in the eddies, an effect driven by the fewer but longer mature postflexion larvae as compared to the greater number of smaller preflexion larvae (@fig:length-feature). Temperature had a small positive effect on the length of Mullidae larvae (@tbl:length-glm-output).

#### Pomacentridae

No significant patterns of OVM were seen for Pomacentridae larvae, most likely due to the small sample size of postflexion larvae (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output, @tbl:catch-summary). Similar to most families, Pomacentridae larvae were rarely found in the deep depth (@fig:stage-prop). The length of Pomacentridae larvae significantly increased at each depth (@fig:length-depth; @tbl:length-glm-output). Eddies did not increase the overall concentration of Pomacentridae larvae (@fig:conc-feature), but within an eddy there were fewer Pomacentridae larvae in the deep layer. (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The larvae were slightly longer inside an eddy (@fig:length-feature). Temperature was found to have a negative effect on both the length and concentration of larvae (@tbl:water-summary). The length of Pomacentridae larvae was also negatively predicted by salinity, and positively predicted by dissolved oxygen.

#### Scaridae

Scaridae larvae did not show significant patterns of OVM, similarly to Pomacentridae; there was a low abundance for one ontogenetic stage that could hinder observing patterns (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output, @tbl:catch-summary). Scaridae larvae were significantly longer at the deep depth than the other two depths (@fig:length-depth). Eddies increased the abundance of Scaridae larvae (@fig:conc-feature), but not the length (@fig:length-feature). Salinity was the strongest predictor of length, with increases in salinity associated with shorter larvae (@tbl:length-glm-output; @tbl:water-summary).

#### Scorpaenidae

Scorpaenidae larvae showed strong downwards OVM patterns with each ontogenetic stage (@fig:stage-weight; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), driven by preflexion larvae that occurred in high abundances at the surface and middle depths, flexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at middle depth, and postflexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at middle and deep layers. The length relationship with depth showed the same downwards pattern, but it was not as defined, with a large increase in length occurring at the deep depth (@fig:length-depth). Overall concentration did not increase within an eddy, but flexion and postflexion larvae were found at increased concentrations, 5.8 times and 10.4 respectively (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output; @fig:conc-feature), and the larvae were also more than 1 mm longer on average (@fig:length-feature). Increasing water temperature was associated with increasing abundance of Scorpaenidae while the increasing Salinity was associated with longer Scorpaenidae larvae (@tbl:water-summary).

#### Serranidae

Serranidae were observed to show strong downwards OVM patterns, moving deeper with each ontogenetic stage (@fig:stage-weight; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The preflexion larvae were found at the surface and middle depths, the flexion larvae spread out across all three depths, and the postflexion larvae were found predominately at the deep depth range. This pattern was reflected by the increasing average larvae length with depth (@fig:length-depth). Serranidae were shorter in eddies compared to coastal waters (@fig:length-feature) and there was no effect on concentration. Increased concentration was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen, and the increasing temperature was associated with longer Serranids.

#### Synodontidae

Synodontidae larvae ontogenetically migrated downwards from preflexion to flexion and then did not change their centre of mass (@fig:stage-weight; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). No significant effect of depth on length was found, possibly due to the few but long postflexion larvae skewing the mean lengths (@tbl:catch-summary). Synodontidae larvae entrained in eddies were on average 30% longer compared to coastal waters (@fig:length-feature), but they were not more abundant (@fig:conc-feature). The only environmental variable that positively predicted abundance was temperature (@tbl:water-summary).

Discussion
----------

This study provides evidence of ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns in many typical temperate fish families of south-eastern Australia. It also highlights that while there were substantial effects of the water mass and associated environmental characteristics on the abundance and length of the families considered, these mesoscale oceanographic features did not seem to affect the ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns.

### Vertical distribution patterns

In all seven families, there were either ontogenetic shifts with depth or changes in the lengths of larvae at different depths. For stage-abundance, only the Pomacentridae and Scaridae families did not display significant patterns. All of the families with stage-abundance patterns showed ontogenetic shifts downwards, excepting Mullidae. Depth had an effect on length for all but one family, Synodontidae. Longer larvae were found at the deep layer, or in the surface and deep layers. The same pattern was not always seen in both stage-abundance and length. Length analysis does not show ontogenetic patterns as distributions as clearly as stage-abundance, as variations in the relative abundance of different stages, especially larger, post-flexion fish, can have large impacts on the length distribution at a particular depth.

Similar results to those presented here have been found in coral reef fish, whereby an overall trend for a downward ontogenetic shift of the centre of mass of larval fish was seen [@irisson2010]. However, in contrast to my results, another study in south-eastern Australia found larval fish did not show any changes in vertical distribution with ontogeny [comparing only two ontogenetic stages: preflexion and postflexion; @gray1998]. These patterns suggest ontogenetic development in ichthyoplankton provides a greater ability to vertically migrate throughout the water column, and they display a preference to move deeper. Whether this migration consists of larvae specifically moving to deeper depths, or the vertical swimming range of larvae increasing with development and thus moving down the centre of mass is unclear [@irisson2010].

The results of this study are consistent with previous work to varying degrees for the different fish families. Labridae larvae have been shown to not change their vertical position with ontogeny [@gray1998; @cowen2002], or to migrate downwards with ontogeny [@irisson2010; @huebert2011]. This study found Labridae larvae to also migrate deeper with ontogeny, with the distinction from previous studies that longer larvae were also found at the surface. Interestingly, the length distribution of Labridae predicted that longer larvae were in the surface rather than the middle depth, yet stage-abundance did not capture this relationship, instead suggesting Labridae larvae migrate downwards upon reaching flexion; an example of how length distributions alone do not always capture the patterns of ontogeny.

Serranidae larvae have been shown to vertically migrate deeper with ontogeny [@irisson2010; @huebert2011], a pattern I also observed here in both stage abundance and length data. Not all studies fully agreed with the findings from this study, suggesting strong species heterogeneity, among other factors.

Mullidae larvae are considered surface dwelling [@mccormick1993; @uiblein2007], and these results partly support this, with all ontogenetic stages found in high proportions at the surface. A previous study off the NSW coastline found Mullidae larvae were common at the surface and rare at 20 m [@gray1993], yet this study found a high proportion of all stages within the middle depth. One possible explanation for the increased vertical distribution seen in these results within the middle depth (range 5-50 m), many larval fish were potentially caught within the range 5-20 m. Giving some support to this was the rareness of Mullidae larvae in the deep layer.

Pomacentridae larvae have been shown to migrate vertically downwards [@paris2004] or upwards [@irisson2010] with ontogeny. While no significant stage-abundance vertical migration pattern was found in these results for Pomacentridae, it did suggest a downward shift and is supported by Pomacentridae larvae having increased length at the depths below the surface. The low sample size of postflexion Pomacentridae larvae most likely contributed to the statistical non-significance of the results in the stage-abundance results.

Scaridae larvae have been seen to migrate downwards with increasing length [@huebert2011]. However, these results found no change in vertical distribution for either length or stage-abundance. Similar to Pomacentridae, low sample sizes of preflexion Scaridae larvae could have contributed to the non-significant OVM findings.

Scorpaenidae showed strong structured patterns of ontogenetic downward shifts in vertical distribution. However, other studies on Scorpaenidae saw no changes in their vertical distribution [@huebert2011] or that larvae concentrated towards the surface and rarely found below 50 m [@kuwahara1983]. These contrasting results suggest Scorpaenidae have heterogenous vertical migration patterns. Another explanation is the differences of geographical location, this study took place in temperate waters off Australia, compared to the temperate waters of Wakasa Bay, Japan [@kuwahara1983] or the tropical waters in the Straits of Florida [@huebert2011].

While I could find no specific studies on the changes in vertical distribution of Synodontidae larvae they are considered to be rare at the surface [@leis1991]. The findings of this study partly support this observation in that stage-abundance did show a downwards migration from preflexion to flexion. However, Synodontidae larvae were relatively common at the surface and included many that were well developed. The occurrence of these late-stage and large individuals at the surface is likely the reason I did not observe an increase in average length with depth which would match the stage abundance patterns.

Pooling larvae into taxa at the family level potentially conceals divergent species-specific patterns and therefore confounded the results. The decision was made in order to increase sample size, and because of both the potential for mis-identification and time constraints of identifying ichthyoplankton down to species-level without using DNA barcoding [@ko2013]. It also provides a relevant starting point for modellers requiring early-life history information on vertical distribution patterns of larval fish. Also, the sampling approach used cannot measure the larval behaviour and only provide information on the distribution [@pearre1979]. Another method to measure the behaviour involves obtaining vertical migration distributions using observations by divers [@leis2010]. Observational data does measure actual behaviour but it is limited by the length of time divers can spend in the water and how deep they can safely go to make observations, and cannot be done over the depths and spatial scales used in this study. The traditional net sampling method most likely under-sampled postflexion larvae for several of the families due to the ability to evade the nets [@leis2006]. Gear avoidance contributes to this under sampling, but high larval mortality also causes an over representation of younger larval fish making a balanced sampling design difficult. Nevertheless, changes in patterns of vertical migration were identified. Alternative hypotheses are that the vertical range of fish increases with ontogeny, allowing individuals to move more, rather than wholesale ontogenetic shifts [@irisson2010]. @irisson2010 also suggested the observed patterns could be due to larval mortality. If predation differed with depth and changed with ontogenetic stage or length, similar changes in patterns of vertical distribution might be seen.

### Effects of oceanography

There was no effect of cyclonic eddy on the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns when compared to the coastal waters. The reef-associated ichthyoplankton of the studied taxa are known to be commonly found within the top 100 m of the water column, and the thermocline depth did not change between coastal water and the eddies sampled. Even though cyclonic eddies are predicted to have higher nutrient rich waters, increased food availability had no effect on the centre of mass for the ontogenetic stage. It was predicted that older and longer larvae would be found in the eddy waters compared to the coastal waters as growth rates are seen to increase inside an eddy, improving survivorship [@shulzitski2015; @shulzitski2016]. The length of the larval fish was greater inside an eddy, with the exception of Scaridae, and that is most likely a result of the small sample size of postflexion larvae. Entrainment of larval fish within eddies is a well understood phenomena [@matis2014; @syahailatua2011], but the effects of entrainment are less understood, with hypotheses of limiting dispersal and allowing for local retention [@reiss2000], and increasing survival through increased food availability [@sabates2013]. Similar increases in larval length have been seen in mesoscale eddies off NSW for sardine larvae [@mullaney2013]. Increased abundance of postflexion larvae was only seen in two families, even though longer larvae were found - suggesting that the water feature has more of an effect on the size of the larvae compared to the development. An alternative explanation for these patterns is that regular spawning of reef fish larvae leads to continued entrainment of preflexion larvae into the eddies, reducing any noticeable effect of stage-abundance.

### Environmental variation

Environmental factors were also important in explaining the differences in larval abundance. The environmental variables measured explained some of the patchiness in larval fish assemblages seen between stations. It has been shown that ichthyoplankton distributions are inherently patchy [@gray1993; @cowen1993], with temperature, salinity, light, tide, and flow, all influencing assemblages [@leis2006] and vertical distribution [@aceves-medina2008]. Complexity is further increased by these factors interacting, such that every single factor has been seen to explain only a small amount of the variability of assemblages [@cowen1993]. Temperature had the strongest effect, seen to predict both abundance and length for several families. A strong positive effect of temperature was seen most strongly in Mullidae, which can be explained by the preflexion and postflexion larvae commonly found in the warmer surface waters. In general, increasing temperature was a positive predictor of abundance, Pomacentridae were the exception with an inverse pattern observed. Salinity was only a positive predictor of Scaridae abundance but was a significant predictor of length in four of the families. Dissolved oxygen positively predicted the abundance of Mullidae and Serranidae, suggesting that ichthyoplankton migrate to areas of increased phytoplankton for feeding. However, this relationship was not consistent, with lower Pomacentridae abundance negatively associated with dissolved oxygen.

### Limitations and future directions

One limitation of the study was the coarseness of the depth ranges used. Only sampling the surface waters, 5-50 m, and 50-100 m depth bins do not allow for finer ontogenetic vertical migration distributional patterns to be captured. It has been argued that ontogenetic vertical migration is a moderate adjustment in the water column and not stratification [@huebert2011], which is more difficult to capture using coarser depth scales. It would also be useful to sample for vertical distributions patterns during different temporal scales, from day/night time scales to seasonal scales and to test the consistency of these ontogenetic vertical distributions. The difficulty is that the cost of sampling by tows is increased over spatial and temporal scales. As a general rule, oceanographic sampling studies suffer from issues of under sampling at both the spatial scale (only 16 stations), and the ability to measure all of the factors affecting assemblages in the water column. There are additional complications when comparing ichthyoplankton sampling studies using different gears [@heino2011], although calibration techniques are being developed to control for sampling gear [@kwong2018]. Replication of eddy water masses in this study was limited (two eddy and two coastal sites), which also limits the inference of patterns. Future studies should involve more stratified sampling, sampling across different time frames to detect seasonal ontogenetic changes, and comparisons between day and night to understand patterns of diel vertical migration. High resolution stratified sampling also allows for investigating the interactions of environmental variables and depth on the vertical position of the larval fish.

Conclusion
----------

Ontogenetic vertical distributions are not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, but the general pattern for these seven families was to increase depth with age. When ichthyoplankton do exhibit patterns that could be associated with ontogenetic vertical migration, variables of length and stage-abundance can show contrasting patterns because of the large influence of the relative abundance of different stages. Nevertheless, much of this variability can be put down to the difficulty in sampling individual larvae across all ontogenetic stage groups. Even when vertical patterns are seen, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also affect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The vertical migration shown for the sampled ichthyoplankton have the potential to influence their dispersal due to differences in current velocities across a stratified water column. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.
