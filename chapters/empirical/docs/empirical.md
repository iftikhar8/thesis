# Do temperate reef ichthyoplankton of New South Wales reveal patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, and do these pattens change when ichthyoplankton are entrained in eddies?

## Introduction

Ichthyoplankton are generally hatched from eggs with a limited behavioural set of capabilities, but with the onset of ontogenetic development they increase their competency to swim, sense and orientate over a short period of time [days to weeks; @leis2006]. Historically, larval dispersal was thought to be driven predominately by ocean currents and the length of pelagic larval duration of the species [@williams1984]. Other effects were considered negligible due to the weak swimming ability of larvae. Subsequently we have found out that behaviour plays a big part in the dispersal of ichthyoplankton. The ability of larval fish to change their vertical position in the water column increases local retention [@paris2007a]. Ichthyoplankton can often sustain horizontal swimming speeds greater than the prevailing currents, allowing them to choose their own path of dispersal [@leis2006a; @fisher2000]. Further, the larvae of many species can also detect and orientate towards settlement habitat using their senses to detect water chemistry, sound, and visual cues [@kingsford2002; @leis2010]. These factors in combination enable larvae to choose between reefs, i.e. search for higher quality habitat or evince a preference to settle close to the natal reef [@jones2005; @gerlach2007a]. Behavioural traits influencing dispersal are particularly important for many reef fish species with bipartite life histories, a pelagic larval phase and sessile adult phase. The dispersal, and thus connectivity between populations, occurs during its pelagic larval phase.

One commonly observed behavioural trait of fish is the tendency to migrate vertically through the water column. These movement patterns might be in response to their development (ontogenetic vertical migration, OVM) or to daily light/dark cycles (diel vertical migration, DVM). The ability of larvae to regulate their depth from the time of hatching is independent of the ability to sense, orientate, and swim [all behaviours that develop later in life; @leis2010]. The vertical distribution patterns of diel [@lampert1989] and ontogenetic [@gronkjaer1997] vertical migration are well represented in the literature. The evolutionary advantage of vertical migration is generally believed to reduce mortality due to predator avoidance [especially visual predators in the case of diel vertical migration; @lampert1989]. It has also been hypothesised that vertical migration provides metabolic advantages based by allowing ichthyoplankton to change their thermal environment [@wurtsbaugh1988]. Changing position in the water column allows for indirectly affecting dispersal due to changes in current velocities and directions with depth [@paris2004a; @paris2007a]. Either through physical processes such as Ekman transport [@sponaugle2002] or by selective tidal transport in and out of estuaries [@hare2005].

While it is increasingly acknowledged that vertical migration affects dispersal and population connectivity, general patterns of OVM are not well understood. Although, it has been suggested that the overall biomass of larval reef fish tends to get deeper in the water column with ontogeny [@paris2004; @irisson2010]. Species specific patterns are relatively unknown as ontogenetic vertical patterns are not consistent, varying between and within species, and over spatial contexts [@leis2010]. Therefore, localised studies are required to determine the vertical migration patterns of ichthyoplankton. This study focuses on investigating the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval reef fish in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. While there have been many studies on the vertical distribution of larval assemblages off the NSW coast [@dempster1997; @gray2000; @keane2008], changes in vertical distribution with development are less well studied. OVM has not been explicitly studied off the coast of NSW, but the relationship between length and depth, comparing surface to deeper off-shore waters [@gray1993] and DVM patterns between preflexion and postflexion larval fish [@gray1998] have been investigated. Understanding this early-life history of larval fish is important for parameterising biophysical models, since reducing the number of assumptions improves the accuracy of a model [@leis2007b].

The eastern coast of Australia has complex ocean conditions, a rugged coastline with a narrow continental shelf and a strong near-shore boundary current (the East Australian Current, EAC). Previous studies have suggested that over short time periods, passive advection can explain observed dispersal patterns [@smith1999]. However, it is hypothesised that vertical migration has the ability to strongly influence dispersal in the region by indirectly avoiding the EAC. The EAC often spawns warm-core and cold-core eddies off the coast of New South Wales at any latitude, concentrated below 32°S [@suthers2011; @everett2012] and these eddies entrain continental shelf waters, bringing with them both pelagic eggs and newly hatch larval fish and providing nutrient rich environments for them to develop and potentially reducing predation [@shulzitski2015; @mullaney2013; @matis2014]. Simulation studies have shown that eddy speed, fish swimming speed [@chang2017], and the vertical distribution of fish [@condie2016] can influence the retention time within an eddy. However, to my knowledge no studies have empirically investigated how eddies effect the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval fish.

In this study I investigated the vertical distribution of larvae in different oceanographic features (eddy versus no-eddy) off the coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia using depth-stratified plankton tows. It must be noted that the sampling method only infers the vertical distribution and does not inform about the specific behaviour leading to these patterns [@pearre1979]. My aim was to determine the ontogenetic patterns of vertical distribution of temperate reef fish families off NSW (estimated both by fish length and ontogenetic stage), and if the nature of these patterns are dependent on the surrounding oceanography (presence of an eddy or not). I expected that reef fish larvae entrained in eddies will be both further developed and longer in length within eddies than coastal waters, but did not expect their depth distribution patterns to be fundamentally different to those fish found outside the eddies.

## Methods

Sampling was undertaken along the eastern coast of Australia on Australian Marine National Facility's RV _Investigator_ (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2013_V03). We sampled 16 stations across two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC; @fig:stations). The location of the frontal eddies were calculated onboard using real time data and novel techniques [@roughan2017]. At each station we sampled for larval fish using two different net types, a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) and a Neuston net. Both nets had a 1 m^2^ mouth area and 500 μm mesh. The MOCNESS system sampled over two different depth ranges, 5-50 m and 50-100 m, conducting two 10-minute tows over each depth range. The Neuston net captured larval fish at the near surface level (0-5 m) and was deployed for two 10-minute tows per station. In total there were two tows at each depth per station. Neuston and MOCNESS nets were deployed at the same time and all tows were conducted between sunset and sunrise to remove any confounding effect of diel vertical migration. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, including dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were taken on the MOCNESS net at each station. Each net had a flow sensor, enabling concentrations of larval fish per cubic metre to be calculated. For each sample pair per station, each sample was preserved in 10% buffered formalin solution. But for one sample per net, larger fish that could be easily identified in the sample by eye were removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 70% ethanol solution in case genetic or otolith analysis was required later on some of the larval fish. In total, 36.4% of the ichthyoplankton was preserved in ethanol, with a slight bias towards postflexion fish (postflexion fish made up 59.0% of the ichthyoplankton preserved in ethanol and only 20.7% of the fish preserved in formalin). The ad hoc selection process for ethanol preservation was used at all stations. Both samples were used in the analyses and no correction for shrinkage was made for the ethanol samples. Therefore the measurements of postflexion larvae could be biased towards under measurement of length [the exact level of shrinkage is species and even individual specific; @pepin1998], but we did not compare across groups and the effect on the results is predicted to be minimal. Total lengths of postflexion larvae preserved in either formalin or ethanol only differed for two families; Labridae (p < 0.001) and Scaridae (p < 0.05). In these cases the smaller larvae preserved in formalin could be due to bias of larger larvae selected for ethanol preservation.

### Data processing

In the laboratory each zooplankton sample was sorted to seperate out the ichthyoplankton. The samples were rinsed to remove excess formalin and preserved in 70% ethanol solutions. The larval fish were then sorted by morphological features and identified to family taxonomic level where possible, referring to reference guides and expert help where appropriate [@moser1996; @leis2000; @neira1998]. For our analysis the most abundant (greater than 100 captured) reef associated fish families were identified from the samples, which were the family groups: Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. For ichthyoplankton, ontogenetic stages can be broadly defined relative to the developmental hallmark of flexion, marked by the beginning of the development of the caudal fin when the notochord bends upwards and fin rays start to develop. For this study we classified the fish into three broad categories of ontogenetic stage, i.e. preflexion, flexion, or postflexion (@fig:stages). Each fish was photographed using a calibrated stereo microscope and the standard length (SL) was measured to the nearest μm using the image acquisition software Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Insight Version 8.

### Data analysis


In order to evaluate the effect of depth and oceanographic feature on OVM patterns I used general linear models (GLMs) with either length or abundance (concentration) as the response variable (@tbl:glm-models). A separate GLM was constructed for each of the seven families and the two response variables (length and abundance), using the independent factors of feature (levels: eddy or coastal), and depth (levels: 0-5, 5-50, 51-100 m). The stage-abundance data was analysed with concentration (individuals per 1000 m^3^) as the response variable and using ontogenetic stage (levels: preflexion, flexion, postflexion) as a factor. For visualising the stage-abundance, the centre of mass for each fish family and ontogenetic stage was calculated, taken as the mean depth of each net and weighted by the proportion of larval stage sampled within the net. Water characteristics of temperature (°C), salinity (PSI), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Volts), values were calculated for the depth range covered by each net at each station and included in the model to explain variability associated with the specific location of each station within the broader region.

For each family, GLMs were initially constructed using a backwards approach (described as the full model; @tbl:glm-models), including each possible predictor variable and then using Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection to remove non-significant predictors until a model with the maximum significant predictors and lowest possible AIC was identified [@zuur2007]. Reduced models were only considered if they were significantly different from each other using Chi-square tests on residual sum of squares. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were highly correlated with each other (r^2^ = 0.73), and therefore only one was included in any model at a time, but both were tested for significance separately (@tbl:glm-models).

The stage-abundance data was analysed using a negative binomial distribution, the abundance was standardise using concentration (individuals per 1000 m^3^) per filtered volume of water per net calculated from the flow meter. The negative binomial distribution was chosen to account for the over-dispersion of the data due to the high number of zeros. Despite the large number of zero observations, no models were considered to be zero-inflated after comparing the expected zeros of the data with a negative binomial model and a zero-inflated negative binomial model [@zuur2009]. The larval fish length data was fitted with GLMs using a gamma distribution and log link function to account for the bounded non-normal distribution (possibly due to gear selection and high larval mortality), a common distribution used for fish length data [@pitcher2002]. Patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration were considered to be evident if in the stage-abundance models there was a depth x stage (DxS) interaction, and in the length models there was an effect of depth (@tbl:glm-models).

For conciseness, only the Wald chi-square analysis of deviance test results are presented. Post-hoc analysis of the GLMs were performed using pairwise tests on the least squares means with a Tukey adjustment. All analysis was conducted using the R programming language [@rcoreteam2017]. The following R packages were used in the analysis; *MASS* was used for negative binomial GLMs [@venables2002], *car* [@fox2011] and *DHARMa* [@hartig2017] were used for model validation, and *lsmeans* [@lenth2016] and *multcomp* [@hothorn2008] were used for GLM post-hoc analysis.

## Results

The seven reef associated families comprised 2827 fish in total, of which 44.3% came from the family Labridae (@tbl:catch-summary). One surface tow at station 8 was not included in the analysis because there were no flowmeter readings to determine concentration, and at station 16 the surface nets were not deployed due to rough conditions. Labridae were the most abundant of the seven families. There were differences in catches of ontogenetic stages, with some families such as Serranidae and Mullidae dominated by small preflexion larvae and Labridae was dominated by larger postflexion larvae (@tbl:catch-summary). Pomacentridae and Scaridae had low samples of postflexion and preflexion respectively. For Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae, and Scorpaenidae, more than 65% of the larvae were sampled from water within an eddy (@tbl:catch-summary). Synodontidae were the longest larvae with a mean of 10.35 mm and Serranidae were the shortest overall at 3.22 mm.

### Ontogenetic vertical migration patterns

For stage-abundance, the most parsimonious model for six of the seven families contained an interaction term between ontogenetic stage and depth, only the model for Scaridae did not have a interaction term (@tbl:results-models). The interaction between ontogenetic stage and depth, suggesting ontogenetic vertical migration, was significant for the families Labridae, Mullidae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae and Synodontidae (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).

In general, most larvae across all ontogenetic stages were captured in the top 50 m of the water column  (@fig:stage-prop). Preflexion larvae were almost exclusively found in the top 50 m. the only larvae to occur in high proportions at 50-100 m, were Serranidae flexion and postflexion larvae, and Scorpaenidae postflexion larvae. Of the five families showing stage-abundance vertical migration, there were three patterns general patterns; migrate downwards with flexion (1), migrate downward with flexion and then upwards with postflexion (2), migrate downwards with flexion and further downwards with postflexion (3; @fig:stage-weight). Pattern (1) was seen in Labridae and Synodontidae larvae, (2) in Mullidae, and (3) in Scorpaenidae and Serranidae. Similar migration was observed in Scaridae and Pomacentridae, patterns (2) and (3) respectively, the changes into ontogenetic abundance were not significant.

Each reef fish family had depth as a predictor of length (@tbl:results-models), however, it was only a significant predictor for six of the families, with Synodontidae showing no effect (@tbl:length-glm-output). The effect of depth on length exhibited three general patterns; the larvae were shorter at 5-50 m and longer at the surface and 50-100 m (1), the larvae increasing in length below 50 m (2), or the larvae shortest at the surface (3; @fig:length-depth). Pattern (1) was observed for Labridae and Mullidae larvae. Scaridae, Serranidae and Scorpaenidae larvae all displayed pattern (2). Pomacentridae was the only family to display pattern (3). Apart from Synodontidae, where length was not different across the three depths, the larvae were shorter on average in the top 50 m.

### Does vertical migration change within an Eddy?

Feature (eddy or coastal waters) did not influence the patterns of OVM. For stage-abundance, the only parsimonious model that included the three-way interaction of Feature x Stage x Depth was Pomacentridae, but the interaction was not significant (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). An interaction between Feature x Depth was not included in any of the parsimonious length models (@tbl:results-models). In general, eddies had higher abundances (@fig:conc-feature; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output) and longer ichthyoplankton (@fig:length-feature; @tbl:length-glm-output), than the coastal waters. Although, this was not consistent across all families, with no effect of feature on the concentration of Labridae, Mullidae, and Scaridae, and no effect of feature on the length of Scaridae.

### Effect of water characteristics on abundance and length

Temperature was the common predictor of both abundance (significant for five families) and length (significant for four families) of the sampled larval fish, although the direction of the effect was not consistent across families (@tbl:water-summary). Salinity predicted abundance in one family, Scaridae larvae, but predicted the length in three families (negative predictor for Pomacentridae and Scaridae, positive predictor for Scorpaenidae). Dissolved oxygen predicted the abundance of Scaridae (negative) and Serranidae (positive), and only had an effect on the length of Pomacentridae (positive). In a similar trend, chlorophyll fluorescence was a negative predictor of abundance for Mullidae and Pomacentridae larvae, and only a negative predictor for the length of Labridae.

### Family summaries

#### Labridae

Labridae larvae moved down the water column with flexion, with more flexion and postflexion larvae found below 50 m than preflexion (p < 0.001; @fig:stage-prop). The postflexion larvae were more abundant in the surface waters than flexion larvae. This pattern was reflected in the length model, which had the shortest larvae at 25 m, and the longest at both the surface and 75 m (@fig:length-depth). Labridae larvae were more abundant in eddies (@fig:conc-feature), and the entrained larvae were on average 1.14 times longer than found in coastal waters (@fig:length-feature). Eddies had increased abundance of Labridae postflexion larvae, but also increased the concentration of larvae at the surface waters when compared to coastal waters (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).   Temperature was found to have a positive effect on the abundance, but a negative effect on the length of Labridae larvae (@tbl:water-summary). Chlorophyll fluorescence also had a negative effect on Labridae length.

#### Mullidae

Mullidae larvae were most common at the surface and 25 m depths for all ontogenetic stages. The centre of mass moved downwards from preflexion to flexion (@fig:stage-weight), but upwards from flexion to postflexion (@fig:stage-prop). Postflexion larvae were also found to occur at 75 m more than preflexion larvae (p = 0.045). This pattern is supported in part by the length data, with the postflexion larvae in the surface and 75 m driving the patterns of longer lengths at these depths (@fig:length-depth). Overall, Mullidae larvae were more abundant inside eddies (@fig:conc-feature), but this was driven by preflexion larvae were 15.9 times more abundant (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Flexion and postflexion Mullidae larvae were found in lower numbers in eddies compared to the coastal waters. In contrast, the Mullidae larvae were on average longer in the eddies, suggesting longer mature postflexion larvae cancelled out the effect of more smaller preflexion (@fig:length-feature). Increasing temperature had a small positive effect on the length of Mullidae larvae (@tbl:length-glm-output).

#### Pomacentridae

No significant patterns of OVM were seen for Pomacentridae larvae, most likely due to the small sample size of postflexion larvae (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output, @tbl:catch-summary). Similar to most families, Pomacentridae larvae were rarely found at 75 m (@fig:stage-prop). The length of Pomacentridae larvae significantly increased at each depth (@fig:length-depth; @tbl:length-glm-output). Eddies did not increased the concentration of Pomacentridae larvae (@fig:conc-feature), but the concentration of larvae at 75 m was decreased (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The larvae were slightly longer inside an eddy (@fig:length-feature). Temperature was found to have a negative effect on both the length and concentration of larvae (@tbl:water-summary). The length of Pomacentridae larvae was also negatively predicted by salinity, and positively predicted by dissolved oxygen.

#### Scaridae

Scaridae larvae did not show significant patterns of OVM, similarly to Pomacentridae, there was a low abundance for one ontogenetic stage that could hinder observing patterns (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output, @tbl:catch-summary). Scaridae larvae were significantly longer at 75 m, than the other two depths (@fig:length-depth). Eddies increased the abundance of Scaridae larvae (@fig:conc-feature), but not the length (@fig:length-feature). Salinity was the strongest predictor of length, with increases in salinity associated with shorter larvae (@tbl:length-glm-output; @tbl:water-summary).

#### Scorpaenidae

Scorpaenidae larvae showed strong downwards OVM patterns with each ontogenetic stage (@fig:weighted-depth; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), driven by preflexion larvae that occurred in high abundances at the surface and 25m, flexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at 25 m, and postflexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at 25 and 75 m. The length relationship with depth showed the same downwards pattern, but it was not as defined, with the large increase in length occurring at 75 m (@fig:length-depth). Overall concentration did not increase within an eddie, but flexion and postflexion larvae were found at increased concentrations, 5.8 times and 10.4 respectively (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output; @fig:conc-feature), and the larvae were also more than 1 mm longer on average (@fig:length-feature). Increasing water temperature was associated with increasing abundance of Scorpaenidae, while increasing Salinity was associated with longer Scorpaenidae larvae (@tbl:water-summary).

#### Serranidae

Serranidae were observed to show strong downwards OVM patterns, moving deeper with each ontogenetic stage (@fig:weighted-depth; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The preflexion larvae were found at the surface and 25 m, the flexion larvae spread out across 0-100 m, and the postflexion larvae were found predominately at 75 m. This pattern was reflected by the increasing average larvae length with depth (@fig:length-depth). Serranidae were not longer in eddies compared to coastal waters (@fig:length-feature) and there was no effect on concentration. Increased concentration was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen, and increasing temperature was associated with longer Serranids.

#### Synodontidae

Synodontidae larvae ontogenetically migrated downwards from preflexion to flexion, and then did not change their centre of mass (@fig:weighted-depth; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). No significant effect of depth on length was found, possibly due to the long postflexion larvae found skewing the mean lengths (@tbl:catch-summary). Synodontidae larvae entrained in eddies were on average 30% longer compared to coastal waters (@fig:length-feature), but they were not more abundant (@fig:con-feature). The only environmental variable that positively predicted abundance was temperature (@tbl:water-summary).

## Discussion

This study provides for ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns in a number of commpno temperate fish families of south-eastern Australia. It also highlights whiles there were strong effects of the water mass and associated physical characteristics on the abundance and length of the families considered, these mesoscale oceanographic features did not seem to have much effect on vertical distribution. 

### Vertical migration patterns
In six of the seven families, either older or longer larvae were found deeper, supporting our hypothesis — Scaridae was the only family of fish to not show any migration pattern over the 100 m. Similar results were found with coral reef fish larvae, suggesting while there was an overall trend downwards of the centre of mass, it was driven by an increase in the spread of larval fish in the water column with ontogeny [@irisson2010]. In contrast to our results, a study off NSW found larval fish did not show any changes in vertical distribution with ontogeny [@Gray:1998wk]. The six different migrating families exhibited two distributions; either a downwards migration with ontogeny or a migration where larvae showed bi-directional migration with ontogeny. Suggesting larvae reaching flexion and post-flexion ontogenetic stages have a greater ability to vertically migrate throughout the water column. The same pattern was not always seen in both length or stage-abundance, although this seemed to be driven by the high variability in stage-abundance reducing statistical power and not by contrasting patterns.

Labridae larvae have been shown to not change their vertical position with ontogeny [@Gray:1998wk; @Cowen:2002wb], or to migrate downwards with ontogeny [@Irisson:2010um; @HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011]. This study found Labridae larvae to also migrate downwards with ontogeny, with the distinction from previous studies that longer larvae were also found at the surface. When considering larval length, the distribution of Labridae predicted that longer larvae were in the surface than 25 m, yet stage-abundance did not capture this relationship, instead suggesting Labridae larvae move downwards with ontogenetic stage. Although, this is most likely to the high variability of postflexion larvae found in the surface between stations. Not considering ontogeny, a previous study off the NSW coastline found Mullidae larvae were common at the surface and rare at 20 m [@Gray:1993et]. Similar patterns were seen here, with preflexion and flexion larvae concentrated in the surface (flexion larvae also migrated downwards to 25 m). However, we found postflexion larvae to be abundant at the surface and 25 m. Mullidae larvae are considered surface dwelling [@McCormick:1993hc; @Uiblein:2007em], a possible explanation for the increased vertical distribution seen in our results is that at the depth 25 m (range 5-50 m) many larval fish caught closer to the top of this range than the bottom. Pomacentridae larvae have been shown to both migrate vertically downward with ontogeny [@Paris:2004te] or upwards [@Irisson:2010um], suggesting species heterogeneity. While no stage-abundance vertical migration was was seen in the results, larvae were found to be longer at 25 and 75 m than the surface waters. The low sample size of postflexion Pomacentridae larvae most likely contributed to the non-significance of the results. Scaridae larvae have been seen to migrate downwards with increasing length [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011], however these results showed no change in their vertical distribution when considering length or stage-abundance. Partially explained by the low sample size of smaller preflexion Scaridae larvae, contributed to any non-significant findings. Scorpaenidae showed the strongest structured patterns of vertical distribution, interestingly other studies saw no changes in vertical distribution [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011] or Scorpaenidae larvae concentrated towards the surface and were rarely found below 50 m [@Kuwahara:1983hg]. Serranidae significantly migrated downwards from preflexion considering both length and stage-abundance, patterns that have been previously seen elsewhere [@Irisson:2010um; @HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011]. Synodontidae larvae did show vertical patterns with length, but stage-abundance showed a downwards trend. Several Synodontidae larvae caught at the surface were well developed and much longer than other surface larvae, which potentially have masked patterns of a downwards shift. No studies on the changes in vertical distribution of Synodontidae larvae could be found to support these results, but they are considered to be rare at the surface, contrasting our results with a high abundance of preflexion larvae in the surface [@Leis:1991kl].

### Ontogenetic vertical migration
Ontogenetic shifts downwards in vertical distribution may occur for a number of reasons. Larvae may utilise the faster wind-driven surface currents with different strategies, migrating downwards to increase chances of local retention [@Paris:2004te] or migrating upwards for assisted dispersal, i.e. in the case of slower preflexion larvae. Turbulent surface waters have also been seen to induce ontogenetic shifts in vertical distribution, with preflexion larvae migrating away from turbulent waters [@HernandezEvaluatingdielontogenetic2009]. Changes in ontogeny can induce changes in metabolic needs, and potential new prey can have different vertical distributions [@Irisson:2010um]. Different patterns between taxa can be driven the differences in diets [@Llopiz:2009cc].

Pooling larvae into taxa at the family level, has the potential to mask divergent species specific patterns and therefore confounded the results. The decision was made to increase sample size, and due to the difficulty and time constraints of identifying species without genetic analysis. It also provides a relevant starting point for modellers requiring early-life history information on vertical distribution patterns of larval fish. Also the sampling approach used cannot measure the larval behaviour and only provide information on the distribution [@pearre1979]. To measure the behaviour, another method is to obtain vertical migration distributions through observation using divers [@Leis:2010jz]. This method does measure actual behaviour but it is limited by the amount of time divers can spend in the water and how deep they can safely go to make observations, and cannot be done over the depths and spatial scales used in this study. The traditional net sampling method most likely under-sampled postflexion larvae for several of the families due to the ability to evade the nets [@tbl:catch-summary; @Leis:2006kf] Although not only gear avoidance contributes to this under sampling, high larval mortality leads to over representation of younger fish making a balanced sampling design difficult. Nevertheless, changes in patterns of vertical migration were identified. Alternative hypotheses are that the vertical range of fish increases with ontogeny, allowing individuals to move more, rather than wholesale ontogenetic shifts [@Irisson:2010um]. @Irisson:2010um also suggested the observed patterns could be due to larval mortality. If predation differed with depth and changed with ontogenetic stage or length, similar changes in patterns of vertical distribution might be seen.

### Effects of feature
As hypothesised, there was no effect of eddy on the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns when compared to the coastal waters. The reef fish ichthyoplankton for the studied taxa are known to be commonly found within the top 100 m of the water column [CITE], and the thermocline depth did not change between coastal water and the eddies sampled. It was predicted that older and longer larvae would be found in the eddy waters compared to the coastal waters as growth rates are seen to increase inside an eddy and improving survivorship [@ShulzitskiCloseencounterseddies2015a; @ShulzitskiEncountermesoscaleeddies2016a]. The length of the larval fish was increased inside the eddies, with the exception of Scaridae, and that is most likely a result of small sample size of postflexion larvae. Entrainment of larval fish within eddies is a well understood phenomena, limiting dispersal and allowing for local retention [@ReissObservationslarvalfish2000]. Similar increases in larval length have been seen in mesoscale eddies off NSW for sardine larvae [@MullaneyEntrainmentretentioncoastal2013b]. Increased abundance of postflexion larvae was only seen in two families, even though longer larvae were found - suggesting that the water feature has more of an effect on the size of the larvae compared to the development. An alternative explanation is that regular spawning of reef fish larvae leads to continued entrainment of preflexion larvae into the eddies, reducing any noticeable effect of stage-abundance.

### Environmental variation
Environmental factors were also driving the differences in larval abundance. The environmental variables measured explained some of the patchiness in larval fish assemblages seen between stations, of which there was high variation. Although it has been shown that ichthyoplankton distributions are inherently patchy [@Gray:1993et; @Cowenhydrographycanphysical1993], with temperature, salinity, light, tide, flow all influencing assemblages @Leis:2006kf Adding to the complexity is that these factors can also interact, such that each single factor has been seen to explain only a small amount of the variability of assemblages [@Cowenhydrographycanphysical1993]. Temperature had the strongest effect, seen to predict both abundance and length for several families. A strong positive effect of temperature was seen most strongly in Mullidae, which can explain by the preflexion and postflexion commonly found in the warmer surface waters. In general, increasing temperature was a positive predictor of abundance, Pomacentridae were the exception with an inverse pattern observed. Salinity was only a positive predictor of Scaridae abundance, but was a significant predictor of length in four of the families. Dissolved oxygen positively predicted the abundance of Mullidae and Serranidae, suggesting that ichthyoplankton migrate to areas of increased phytoplankton for feeding. However, this relationship was not consistent, with lower Pomacentridae abundance negatively associated with dissolved oxygen.


### Limitations and future directions
One limitation of the study was the coarseness of the depth ranges used, only sampling the surface waters, 5-50 m, and 51-100 m layers does not allow for finer ontogenetic vertical migration distributional patterns to be captured. Ontogenetic vertical migration it has been argued is a moderate adjustment in the water column and not stratification [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011], which is more difficult to capture using our coarser depth scales. It would also be useful to sample for vertical distributions patterns during over different temporal scales, from day/night time scales to seasonal scales and to test the consistency of these ontogenetic vertical distributions. The difficulty is in the cost of sampling by tows is increased over spatial and temporal scales. As a general rule, oceanographic sampling studies suffer from issues over under sampling at both the spatial scale (only 16 stations), and the ability to measure all of the factors affecting assemblages in the water column. Future studies should involve more stratified sampling, sampling across different time frames to detect seasonal ontogenetic changes, and comparisons between day and night to understand patterns of diel vertical migration.

## Conclusion
In summary, ontogenetic vertical migration distributions are not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, but the general pattern for these seven families was a downwards migration. When ichthyoplankton do exhibit patterns that could be associated with ontogenetic vertical migration, variables of length and stage-abundance can show contrasting patterns. Nevertheless, much can be put down to the difficulty in sampling individual larvae across all ontogenetic stage groups. Even when vertical patterns are seen, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also effect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.
