CHAPTER 2: Do temperate reef ichthyoplankton in NSW exhibit patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, and does it change for ichthyoplankton entrained in eddies?

# Introduction

Ichthyoplankton (the predominance of teleost fish larvae) are generally hatched from eggs with limited behavioural capabilities, but with the onset of ontogenetic development, increase their competency to swim, sense and orientate over a relatively short period of time (days to weeks). Historically, larval dispersal was thought to be driven by pelagic larval duration and the currents, and any other effect was negligible. Subsequently we have found out that behaviour plays a big part in the dispersal of ichthyoplankton, from allowing them change position in the water column, sense settlement habitat and giving them the ability to choose between reefs, i.e. preference for the natal reef. Behavioural traits influencing dispersal are particularly important for adult sessile fish, where the major mode of dispersal is through its pelagic larval duration. We now know fish larvae can be strong swimmers (both horizontally and vertically), and that swimming ability is highly variable to individual larvae within a species. Many species of fish larvae have been shown they can sustain swimming speeds greater than the surrounding currents allowing for direct influence of dispersal [CITE examples]. Vertical migration, through two mechanisms; either ontogenetic vertical migration or diurnal vertical migration, allow for the indirect influence of dispersal via diverging current velocities in the water column. The ability of larvae to regulate their depth from the time of hatching, is independent of the ability to sense, orientate and swim, behaviours that develop later in life [CITE Leis 2010].

The vertical distribution of larval fish is a fairly well studied area, both diel vertical migration [CITE Diel] and ontogenetic vertical migration [CITE OVM]. Reasons for vertical migration are generally thought to involve predator avoidance (especial visual predators in the case of diel vertical migration). Other factors are thought to be for metabolic advantages based on temperature [CITE Wurtsbaugh 1988], or to assist species with horizontal movement, e.g. selective tidal transport [CITE Hare 2005]. The importance of understanding vertical dispersal patterns is that the vertical distribution fish can indirectly affect their dispersal and connectivity [CITE Paris and Cowan 2004, Sponaugle 2002], by subjecting larvae to current velocities differing in both direction and magnitude. Understanding this behaviour, that in turn affects dispersal and population connectivity, is important in a world of changing ocean dynamics due to environmental and anthropogenic changes changes. It has been shown that changes in vertical position due to ontogeny exists for many species of larval fish [CITE Leis 2006]. In general, patterns show that larval fish get deeper in the water column with ontogeny [CITE Irrison 2010]. Although these pattern have not been exhaustively studied, and have been shown to vary both between species, within individuals of species and also spatially [Leis 2006]. To measure realised patterns of connectivity, more biophysical dispersal studies are including vertical migration [CITE examples]. One reason to not include vertical migration behaviour is that for many species it is unknown. In New South Wales, not many studies have looked at the vertical migration of larval fish (CITe Grays papers). Therefore our study aims to measuring the vertical migration distributions of reef associated families off the coast of New South Wales will allow us to accurately parameterise biophysical connectivity models with ontogenetic vertical migration behaviour to produce realised connectivity patterns.

The eastern coast of Australia has a narrow continental shelf (15-50 km), and a strong current southerly flowing, the East Australian Current (EAC). The EAC often spawns warm-core and cold-core eddies off the coast of New South Wales at any latitude [CITE Suthers EAC paper]. These eddies entrain continental shelf waters, bringing with them both pelagic eggs and newly hatch larval fish and providing nutrient rich environments for them to develop. While not increasing growth rates, cyclonic eddies have been shown to contain older and larger fish larvae than the coastal waters the fish were entrained from [CIE Mullany & Suthers]. In fact for some larval fish assemblages, eddy entrainment is considered essential to their survival [CITE Kasai]. While simulation studies have shown that speed of the eddy and the biological swimming speed of fish [CITE Yu-Lin CHANG] and the the vertical distribution of fish [CITE Condie 2016] can influence the retention time within an eddy, so far no studies to our knowledge have investigated empirically how eddies effect the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval fish.

Several different methods have been used to measure the vertical distribution of fish larvae. The traditional method, and the one used by this study is to investigate the vertical distribution of larvae through conducting plankton tows at different depths in the water column. In this chapter, my first aim is to determine if temperate reef fish families off the coast of New South Wales exhibit patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, either by measuring ontogenetic stage or length. Previously the relationship between length and depth for common species off Sydney has been investigated [CITE Gray 1993], comparing the surfaces waters to deeper in the waters column (changing depending on off-shore distance), as well as looking at the diel vertical migration of preflexion and postflexion larval fish off Sydney [CITE Gray 1998]. This study differed in three approaches, broadening the study area by sampling between -27 and -33 degrees of latitude, sampling 3 depths between 0-100 m, and measuring the larval fish at three ontogenetic stages. My hypothesis, is that the reef fish off NSW will show downward trends of ontogenetic vertical migration through distributions patterns measured by both ontogeny and length. My second aim is to examine if this ontogenetic migration pattern is consistent for larvae retained in eddies. Here it is hypothesised that the assemblages of reef fish larvae entrained in eddies will be both further developed and longer within the eddy, but how that effects the vertical distribution pattern is unknown.

# Methods

Sampling occurred along the eastern coast of Australia on Australian Marine National Facility RV _Investigator_ (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2013_V03). We sampled 16 stations across two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC) [@fig:stations]. The location of the frontal eddies were calculated onboard using real time data and novel techniques [CITE Moninya's paper]. At each station we sampled for larval fish using two different net types, a multiple opening/closing net and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) and a Neuston net. Both nets consisted of 1 m^2^ mouth areas with 500 &mu;m mesh sizes. The MOCNESS system sampled at two different depths 5-50 m and 50-100 m, conducting two 10 minute tows over each depth range (four tows per station). The Neuston net captured larval fish at the near surface level (0-5 m) and was deployed for two 10 minute tows per station. Neuston and MOCNESS nets were deployed at the same time and all tows were conducted between sunset and sunrise to remove any confounding effect of diel vertical migration. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, including dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were taken on the MOCNESS net at each station. Each net had a flow sensor, enabling concentrations of larval fish per cubic metre to be calculated. Each sample was preserved in either 90% ethanol or a 10% buffered formalin solution. Ethanol was used in case genetic or otolith analysis was required later on some of the larval fish, which were generally larger fish that could be seen by the eye and were removed before formalin fixation. Both samples were used in the analyses and no correction for shrinkage was made for the ethanol samples, therefore some of the larger fish will have a shrinkage bias and would have been longer if preserved in formalin. It was a small proportion of the fish and therefore the effect on the results should be minimal.

## Data processing

In the lab each sample was sorted to seperate out ichthyoplankton. The larval fish were then sorted by morphological features and identified to family taxonomic level where possible, referring to reference guides and expert help where appropriate [CITE: books CalCOFI, Leis & Calvert, Miskiwiez et al]. For our analysis the most abundant (greater than 100 captured) reef associated fish families were identified from the samples, which were the family groups Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. For ichthyoplankton, ontogenetic stages can be broadly defined by the beginning of the development of the caudal fin as the notochord bends upwards and fin rays start to develop. For this study we classified the fish into three broad categories of ontogenetic stage, i.e. preflexion, flexion, or postflexion (@fig:stages). Each fish was photographed using a calibrated stereo microscope and the standard length (SL) was measured to &mu;m accuracy using the image acquisition software Image-Pro Insight 8 (<http://www.mediacy.com/imageproinsight>).

![The three stages of ontogeny as seen in Labridae larvae; preflexion where the notochord is straight and no fin rays are present (SL 3.69 mm) (A), flexion (SL 4.17 mm) where the notochord flexes upwards at a 45 degree angle (B), and postflexion (SL 9.34 mm) where the caudal fin has developed (C).](chapters/empirical/figs/stages-ontogeny.png){#fig:stages}

## Data analysis

The data was analysed using general linear models (GLMs) with either length or abundance as the response variable (@tbl:models). Fourteen GLMs for each fish family and each response variable were constructed using a bottom-up approach, building models of single factors and including predicators that were significant until a complete model was constructed which represented the data . The model was then reduced where possible to exclude non-significant interaction predictors using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Instead of modelling location by latitude (northern or central NSW coast) as a random factor, temperature (°C), salinity (PSI), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Volts) values were calculated for the depth range covered by each net at each station. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were highly correlated with each other (r^2^ = 0.73), and therefore only one was included in any model at a time, but both were tested for significance (@tbl:models). The stage-abundance data was analysed using negative binomial distributed GLM with an offset to standardise the abundance using concentration (1000 m^3^) per filtered volume of water per net calculated from the flowmeter. The negative binomial GLM was chosen to account for the over-dispersion of the data. Even though the data contained a large number of zero observations, none of the models appeared to be zero-inflated after comparing the expected zeros of the negative binomial distribution fit to the data with zero-inflated negative binomial models. The larval fish length data were found to be fit GLMs with a gamma distribution and log link function, probably due to sampling bias and high larval mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the GLMs were performed using pairwise tests on the least squares means with a Tukey adjustment. All analysis was conducted using the R programming language [@RAlanguageanden:wf]. The package MASS was used for negative binomial GLMs [CITE], the packages car [CITE] and DHARMa were used for model checking, and the packages lsmeans [CITE] and multcomp [CITE] were used for GLM post-hoc analysis. Figures and tables were made using the package tidyverse [CITE] and stargazer [CITE] respectively.

# Results

The seven reef associated families comprised of 2827 fish in total, of which 44.3% came from the family Labridae (@tbl:catch-summary). One surface tow at station 8 was not included in the analysis because there were no flowmeter readings to get concentration, and at station 16 the surface nets were not deployed due to rough conditions. There were differences in catches of ontogenetic stages, with some families such as Serranidae and Mullidae dominated by small preflexion larvae and  Labridae was dominated by postflexion larvae (@tbl:catch-summary). Pomacentridae and Scaridae had low samples of postflexion and preflexion respectively.

[Depth patterns]
Pomacentridae, Scaridae and Serranidae occurred equally in surface waters and the top 50m, while Labridae, Scorpaenidae, and Synodontidae preferred the 5-50m depth. Mullidae larvae preferred the surface waters. Only Scorpaenidae, Scaridae, and Scorpaenidae occurred in any notable numbers at the deepest depth.

Five of the reef fish families (Labridae, Mullidae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae) exhibited patterns of vertical migration by ontogenetic stage across the three depths (surface = 0 m, mid = 5-50 m, deep = 50-100 m), whereby significant differences were found between concentrations of ontogenetic stages at depth. (@fig:ovm; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Scorpaenidae showed the strongest downward trends of ontogenetic stage vertical migration over the 100 m. Labridae and Synodontidae trended downwards from the surface waters to the mid-depth, and Serranidae trended downwards at the deep depth. Mullidae showed a slight upwards pattern of vertical migration, with postflexion preferring the surface waters. Scaridae and Pomacentridae were found to occur in equal numbers.

*Within depths -* For three families (Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae) the concentration of preflexion larvae at the surface significantly greater than the concentration of another ontogenetic stage (@fig:ovm). Scorpaenidae preflexion larvae was 6 times more abundant that postflexion larvae (p = 0.044), For Serranidae, the surface waters contained each stage was found to occur in different abundances, with preflexion being the highest at 8.5 times flexion larvae (p < 0.001) and 170 times postflexion larvae (p < 0.001). Synodontidae preflexion larvae at the surface occurred in greater numbers than the postflexion larvae (p = 0.018). Both Labridae and Mullidae larvae were found to occur in equal concentrations per stage in the surface, although there was large variation in concentration of postflexion Labridae larvae (@fig:ovm). At the 5-50 m depth, all stages of Labridae, Scorpaenidae and Synodontidae occurred in equal abundances. Mullidae preflexion larvae were 5.3 times more abundant than postflexion (p = 0.003). Similar pattern occurred at 25 m, with pre-flexion larvae occurring 6.2 times more than flexion (p < 0.001) and 52 times more than post-flexion (p < 0.001). Labridae preflexion larvae were in significantly lower numbers than both flexion (p < 0.001) and post-flexion (p < 0.001) at 75 m. Mullidae and Scorpaenidae both both had significant increases in the abundances of postflexion larvae then preflexion larvae; 7.6 times more for Mullidae (p = 0.003) and 5.8 times for Scorpaenidae (p = 0.030). Serranidae followed an different trend, with equal abundances of preflexion and flexion larvae, which were both more than 4 times greater in abundance that postflexion larvae (p = 0.021 and p = 0.034 respectively). Synodontidae occurred in equal abundances at the 75 m depth.

Both Pomacentridae and Scaridae were found in similar proportions at each depth (@fig:ovm). Pomacentridae larvae were found in equal abundances of preflexion and flexion and postflexion combined. There was an effect of depth at 75 m, significantly reducing the overall abundance (p < 0.001; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-pom). For Scaridae larvae, the concentration in the 25 m layer was 3.1 times greater than the surface (p = 0.004). The large variation of larvae concentrations at 75 m meant it was found to not be different to either 25 m or the surface, even though the mean was higher overall. At each depth, flexion and postflexion were found in higher abundance than preflexion.

*Between depths -* Mullidae and Serranidae larvae did not differ in abundance by stage between the surface and 25 m depths. Labridae preflexion and flexion larvae were predicted to be in the surface 41% and 40% less respectively than at 25 m (p~preflexion~ = 0.020, p~flexion~ = 0.017), with no difference between the surface and 25 m for postflexion. Both flexion and post-flexion Scorpaenidae larvae increased in the 25 m depth compared to the surface, 5.8 times (p = 0.029) and 6.5 times (p = 0.025) respectively. For each ontogenetic stage, Mullidae abundance was significantly lower at the 75 m depth than the surface (p~preflexion~ < 0.001, p~flexion~ < 0.001, p~postflexion~ < 0.001). Between the surface and 75m, only Labridae preflexion was found in lower abundance (p = 0.011). Scorpaenidae flexion and postflexion larvae were more abundant at 75 m than the surface (p~flexion~ = 0.011; p~postflexion~ < 0.001). Postflexion Serranidae larvae were found to occur more at 75 m than the surface (p = 0.042). Labridae preflexion larvae was less abundant at 75 m than 25 m (p < 0.001). All ontogenetic stages for Mullidae were less abundant at 75 m (p~preflexion~ < 0.001, p~flexion~ < 0.001, p~postflexion~ = 0.023). Scorpaenidae and Serranidae larvae did not change in stage abundance between 25 m and 75 m. Synodontidae larvae did not differ in abundance by stage between any of the three depths.

[Environmental data]
The abundance of Labridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, and Synodontidae were all strongly positively predicted with temperature (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), whereas Pomacentridae were negatively predicted by temperature (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-pom). Chlorophyll fluorescence was negatively associated with abundance for both Pomacentridae and Mullidae. Dissolved oxygen was a positive predictor for Labridae, but a negative predictor for Synodontidae. Salinity was a negative predictor of Scaridae abundance.

## Length

For five of the seven fish families, depth was a significant predictor of length and there was no interaction between depth and feature (@tbl:length-glm-output). Three families (Pomacentridae, Scorpaenidae, and Serranidae) showed increasing length with depth (@fig:length-depth). Serranidae showed the clearest pattern, significantly increasing in size at each depth. Pomacentridae were significantly longer below the surface (p~5-50~ = 0.0215, p~51-100~ = 0.0146). Scorpaenidae were  longest in the deep water, 1.5 times longer than the surface (p < 0.001), and 1.2 times longer than the middle depth (p = 0.001). No differences in length between the surface and middle depth layer for Scorpaenidae larvae were found (@fig:length-depth). Mullidae and Labridae larvae were smallest in the 5-50 m depth layer and longer at depth 51-100 m than the surface waters. Scaridae and Synodontidae showed no differences in size between any of the three depths.

[Environmental variables]
The length of Labridae (p < 0.001), Mullidae (p < 0.001), Pomacentridae (p < 0.001) and Serranidae (p < 0.001 all were positively predicted by the water temperature (@tbl:length-glm-output). Labridae larval length was positively predicted by chlorophyll fluorescence (p < 0.001). Salinity was a positive predictor of Pomacentridae (p = 0.030) and Scaridae length (p = 0.001), but a negative predictor of the length of Scorpaenidae larvae (p = 0.039). Dissolved oxygen negatively predicted the length of Pomacentridae larvae (p < 0.001).

## Feature
*Stage-abundance-* Labridae occurred in equal abundances in the coastal waters, but in the eddy, preflexion larvae were the least abundant, followed by flexion (p~preflexion-flexion~ = 0.016) and postflexion (p~preflexion-postflexion~ < 0.001; p~flexion-postflexion~ < 0. 001) was the most abundant (@fig:depth-stage-feature). Scorpaenidae flexion larvae abundance increased 5.7 times (p < 0.001) and postflexion larvae 9.5 times (p < 0.001) in the eddy compared to the coastal waters, while preflexion abundance did not vary. Flexion larvae of Synodontidae were more common in the eddy (p = 0.003). In the coastal waters, Labridae was more abundant at 25 m than the surface, but in the Eddy both the surface and 25 m was more abundant than 75 m (p~0m~ = 0.010; p~25m~ < 0.001). Total Synodontidae abundance increased in the eddy 4.9 times at 25 m, when compared to the coastal waters.

*Length-*  Six of the families were significantly longer in an eddy than the coastal waters, Scaridae being the exception where the eddy had no effect on length (@fig:length-family-feature). The greatest effect of eddy was on Mullidae, which were on average predicted to be 3.7 times longer than the larvae in the coastal waters (p < 0.001) and the smallest effect was on Labridae which were only 1.2 times longer (p < 0.001; @tbl:length-glm-output).

# Discussion

## Stage-abundance
Ontogenetic stage distribution patterns were not seen amongst all of the families as predicted, and of the five families that show ontogenetic shifts in distribution, a downward shift pattern was not uniform. Similar downward ontogenetic shifts of the families Labridae, Scorpaenidae and Serranidae as seen in this study, have been seen before [@Gray:1993et; @Irisson:2010um]. Off the NSW coast, a study of vertical migration also saw upwards shifts for Mullidae and no ontogenetic pattern for Pomacentridae [@Gray:1993et]. Pomacentridae in tropical areas have been shown to vertically migrate both downwards [@Paris:2004te] and upwards [@Irisson:2010um] with ontogeny, suggesting strong species-specific trends. In our experiment, the results for Pomacentridae and Scaridae were also hard to analyse due to the low sample numbers for postflexion and preflexion respectively, therefore it is highly possible ontogenetic patterns existed but we could not tease them out. The result was surprising, as we thought the relationship between stage and depth would exist for these families as per the literature, especially over the coarse depths we used. For Scorpaenidae,  families, the pattern supported our hypothesis that more developed larvae (in this case flexion and onwards) were more likely to be present at lower depths (50-100 m). For the other species, while we believe ontogenetic vertical migration patterns to exist, our experimental design appeared was perhaps too coarse to tease these relationships out. We can see there are patterns of difference, but the low catch rate of the different ontogenetic stages across all sites meant the analysis made it difficult to get significant predictors.

## Length
Our hypothesis that fish would increase in size with depth was clearly supported in the families Mullidae, Scorpaenidae and Serranidae and partially supported by Pomacentridae (longer at 5-50 m than the surface) and Labridae (longest at 50-100 m). Synodontidae also showed a trend of being longer at 50-100 m, but it was non-significant. The fish larvae at 50-100 m were also often 2-3 times longer than the other depths, suggesting much older larvae are found in the deeper waters. It has been argued that such a pattern can be seen because that older, larger fish have a increased range and that it is more of a uniform distribution at different length classes than the results suggest [@Irisson:2010um].

## Contrast
Four of the families (Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae and Scorpaenidae) supported our hypothesis, exhibiting the same vertical distribution pattern for both length and stage abundance. However , three of the families had divergent patterns for each of the response variables. Pomacentridae was found to get longer between the surface and 25 m, yet no ontogenic differences were found between the depths. This result is most likely explained by the low number of postflexion Pomacentridae larvae sampled at the 5-50 m depth. Serranidae were found to be longer between the surface waters and 25 m, but there were no differences in the abundances of ontogenetic stages. Synodontidae had the opposite result, with ontogenetic changes between depths, but no differences in length. This result suggests that in general, either larval length or ontogenetic stage can be used to measure the ontogenetic vertical distribution of larvae - but there is potential to miss out on patterns due if only one is used due to the patchiness of larval fish assemblages.

[Environmental Factors]
Environmental factors were also driving the differences in larval abundance, complicating the reasons for the patterns of vertical migration. As environmental variables were a proxy for site, it explains some of the patchiness in larval fish assemblages seen between sites. Although it has been shown that ichthyoplankton distributions are inherently patchy [@Gray:1993et; @Cowen1993uv], with temperature, salinity, light, tide, flow all influencing assemblages [CITE Leis 2006]. Adding to the complexity is that these factors can also interact, such that each single factor has been seen to explain only a small amount of the variability of assemblages [@Cowen1993uv]. Temperature had the strongest effect, seen to predict both abundance and length for several families. It was an especially strong predictor of length in Mullidae, which is not surprising at the many post-flexion are found at the surface waters. This was in general a positive relationship, except for Pomacentridae which were less abundant with increasing temperature, but longer. It could be that there was a mix of tropical and temperate species within each families caught, driving differences in abundance by temperature. Salinity was only a positive predictor of Scaridae abundance, but was a significant predictor of length in four of the families. Dissolved oxygen, which was also highly correlated with chlorophyll, has positive presence predictors for Mullidae and Serranidae, suggesting that ichthyoplankton migrate to areas of increased phytoplankton for feeding. However, this relationship was not consistent, with lower Pomacentridae abundance negatively associated with dissolved oxygen.

## Feature
We predicted that older and longer larvae would be found in the eddy waters compared to the coastal waters, but we only found the pattern of longer larvae to be consistent (occurring in all but one family). Increased abundance of postflexion larvae was only seen in two families, even though longer larvae were found - suggesting that the water feature has more of an effect on the size of the larvae compared to the development. Interestingly no interactions with feature were found, suggesting that patterns of vertical migration are not impacted by the associated water feature that are in.

## Limitations and future directions

It must be noted that nets cannot measure the larval behaviour and only provide information on the distribution [CITE Pearce 1979]. A significant drawback of this method is that these towed studies capture fewer postflexion larvae due to increased net avoidance abilities [CITE Leis 2006]. Another method is to obtain vertical migration distributions through observation using divers [CITE Leis 2009]. This method does measure actual behaviour but it is limited by the amount of time divers can spend in the water and how deep they can safely go to make observations. Vertical distribution patterns can also be obtained using larval fish light traps, although like towing they cannot not measure behaviour. The last method is to measure vertical position of larvae in a laboratory setting, which greatly limits the range of depths that can be studied. To measure development you can either measure the ontogeny by depth, classifying the larval fish to ontogenetic stage or using the larval length. In this study we measured both developmental stage and length to determine which pattern showed clearer ontogenetic vertical migration.

There were several limitations in the experimental design of this study, as expected from the literature, using the traditional net sampling method under sampled postflexion larvae for several of the families due to the ability to evade the nets (@tbl:catch-summary). Although not only gear avoidance contributes to this under sampling, high larval mortality leads to over representation of younger fish. A future direction would be to also sample for the eggs of ichthyoplankton, which can migrate the water column through buoyancy effects [CITE Sundby 2014]. Another limitation was the coarseness of the nets used, only sampling the surface waters, 5-50 m and 50-100 m layers means finer ontogenetic vertical migration distributional patterns are not captured. Ontogenetic vertical migration it has been argued is a moderate adjustment in the water column and not stratification [CITE Huebert 2011], which is more difficult to capture using our coarser depth scales. It would also be useful to sample for vertical distributions patterns during over different temporal scales, from day/night time scales to seasonal scales and to test the consistency of these ontogenetic vertical distributions. The difficulty is in the cost of sampling by tows is increased over spatial and temporal scales. As a general rule, oceanographic sampling studies suffer from issues over under sampling at both the spatial scale (only 16 stations), and the ability to measure all of the factors affecting assemblages in the water column.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, ontogenetic vertical migration is not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, and fish that do ontogenetically migration can display contrasting patterns. Even when vertical patterns do exists, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also effect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change these ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.
