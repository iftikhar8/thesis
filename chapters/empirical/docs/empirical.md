# Do temperate reef ichthyoplankton in NSW exhibit patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, and does it change for ichthyoplankton entrained in eddies?

## Introduction

Ichthyoplankton are generally hatched from eggs with limited behavioural capabilities, but with the onset of ontogenetic development, increase their competency to swim, sense and orientate over a relatively short period of time (days to weeks; @Leis:2006kf]. Historically, larval dispersal was thought to be driven predominately by the ocean currents and dependent on the length of pelagic larval duration and the currents, and other effects being negligible due to the weak swimming ability of larvae [@Williams:1984il]. Subsequently we have found out that behaviour plays a big part in the dispersal of ichthyoplankton, changing vertical position in the water column increases local retention [@Paris:2007hm] , they can sustain horizontal swimming speeds greater than the prevailing currents [@Leis:2006we; @Fisher:2000kn] and sense settlement habitat (using senses to detect water chemistry, sound, and visual cues; @Kingsford2002:vq]. In combination, these factors enable larvae to choose between reefs, i.e. search for higher quality habitat or a preference to settle close to the natal reef [@Jones:2005jjl; @Gerlach:2007gw]. Behavioural traits influencing dispersal are particularly important for adult sessile fish, where the major mode of dispersal is through its pelagic larval phase.

Vertical migration is one such behaviour, through two mechanisms; either ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM; vertical position of the larvae changes with ontogeny) or diel vertical migration (DVM; vertical position of the larvae changes with the diurnal pattern of the sun), that allows for the indirect influence of dispersal via diverging current velocities in the water column [@Paris:2004te]. The ability of larvae to regulate their depth from the time of hatching, is independent of the ability to sense, orientate and swim, behaviours that develop later in life [@Leis:2010jz]. The vertical distribution patterns of larval fish are well represented in the literature, both diel vertical migration [@Lampert:1989ww] and ontogenetic vertical migration [@Gronkjaer:1997dq]. The evolutionary utility of vertical migration is generally thought to involve reduced mortality due to predator avoidance [especially visual predators in the case of diel vertical migration; @Lampert:1989ww]. It has also been suggested that vertical migration may provide metabolic advantages based allowing ichthyoplankton to change their thermal environment [@Wurtsbaugh:1988cg] and that it can facilitate directed horizontal movement where current direction varies with depth, either through physical processes such as consequences of the Coriolis effect [@Sponaugle:2002vg] or by selective tidal transport in and out of estuaries [@Hare:2005kc]. Understanding this behaviour, that in turn affects dispersal and population connectivity, is important in a world of changing ocean dynamics due to environmental and anthropogenic changes changes.

This study focuses on investigating the ontogenetic vertical migration of larval reef fish in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which through connectivity modelling studies has been shown to be important for influencing dispersal patterns [@Paris:2007hm; @Huebert:2011ci]. In general, it appears that larval fish get deeper in the water column with ontogeny [@Irisson:2010um], yet is relatively unknown for many species as ontogenetic vertical patterns are not consistent, varying between species, within species and over spatial contexts [@Leis:2010jz], e.g. Pomacentridae larvae have been shown to migrate vertically downward with ontogeny [@Paris:2004te] or display no changes of depth by ontogeny [@Irisson:2010um]. Therefore to understand the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish. localised studies are required to determine the vertical migration patterns. Previously only the relationship between length and depth for common species off Sydney has been investigated [@Gray:1993et], comparing the surfaces waters to deeper in the waters column (changing depending on off-shore distance), as well as looking at the diel vertical migration of preflexion and postflexion larval fish off Sydney [@Gray:1998wk]

Understanding the early-life history of larval fish is important for parameterising biophysical models, reducing the amount of assumptions improves the accuracy of a model [@Leis:2007jh]. Vertical migration behaviour is considered especially important off the eastern coast of Australia, where complex ocean conditions, e.g. complex coastline with a narrow continental shelf and a strong near-shore boundary current (the East Australian Current, EAC), therefore vertical position can potentially have a strong influence on dispersal in the region. The EAC often spawns warm-core and cold-core eddies off the coast of New South Wales at any latitude, concentrated below 32°S [@Everett:2012bj] and these eddies entrain continental shelf waters, bringing with them both pelagic eggs and newly hatch larval fish and providing nutrient rich environments for them to develop and potentially reducing predation [@Shulzitski:2015fh; @Mullaney:2013ke]. Simulation studies have shown that eddy speed, fish swimming speed [@Chang:2017bq], and the vertical distribution of fish [@Condie:2016kz] can influence the retention time within an eddy. However, to my knowledge no studies has investigated empirically how eddies effect the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval fish.

In this study I investigated the vertical distribution of larvae in different oceanographic features (eddy versus no-eddy) off the coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia using depth-stratified plankton tows. My aim was to determine if temperate reef fish families off NSW exhibit patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration (estimated both by fish length and ontogenetic stage), and if the nature of these patterns are dependent on the surrounding oceanography (presence of an eddy or not). I also expected that reef fish larvae entrained in eddies will be both further developed and longer within the eddy, but did not expect their depth distribution patterns to be fundamentally different to those fish found outside the eddy.

## Methods

Sampling occurred along the eastern coast of Australia on Australian Marine National Facility's RV _Investigator_ (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2013_V03). We sampled 16 stations across two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC; @fig:stations]. The location of the frontal eddies were calculated onboard using real time data and novel techniques [@Roughan:2017hh]. At each station we sampled for larval fish using two different net types, a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) and a Neuston net. Both nets had a 1 m^2^ mouth area and 500 μm mesh. The MOCNESS system sampled over two different depth ranges, 5-50 m and 50-100 m, conducting two 10-minute tows over each depth range. The Neuston net captured larval fish at the near surface level (0-5 m) and was deployed for two 10-minute tows per station. In total there were two tows at each depth per station. Neuston and MOCNESS nets were deployed at the same time and all tows were conducted between sunset and sunrise to remove any confounding effect of diel vertical migration. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, including dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were taken on the MOCNESS net at each station. Each net had a flow sensor, enabling concentrations of larval fish per cubic metre to be calculated. For each sample pair per station, each sample was preserved in 10% buffered formalin solution. But for one sample per net, larger fish that could be seen by the eye and were removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 70% ethanol solution in case genetic or otolith analysis was required later on some of the larval fish. In total, 36.4% of the ichthyoplankton was preserved in ethanol, with a slight bias towards postflexion fish (postflexion fish made up 59.0% of the ichthyoplankton preserved in ethanol ad only 20.7% of the fish preserved in formalin). Both samples were used in the analyses and no correction for shrinkage was made for the ethanol samples. The lengths of the postflexion fish preserved in ethanol could be under measured in length (the exact level of shrinkage is species specific; ), but we did not compare across groups and therefore the effect on results should be neligible.

therefore some of the larger fish will have a shrinkage bias and would have been longer if preserved in formalin. It was a small proportion of the fish and therefore the effect on the results should be minimal.

Always better if you can give some numbers here.  This would really only be a problem if the bias was restricted to certain nets or stations or features.  And its probably not even a problem if it was mainly specific species as you don't compare size across species per se do  you?  So you just want to indicated what percent of the fish in this study were in EtOH and state these were spread across all depths and features relatively evenly given the process used (pick all samples first).  Also good to state what sort of shrinkage we are dealing with as the one thing it could do is, if it was mainly big fish in the etoh, is bring the average size of those big fish, and I guess overall, down a bit.  So good know how much that could have happened.

## Data processing

In the lab each zooplankton sample was sorted to seperate out the ichthyoplankton. The samples were rinsed to remove excess formalin and preserved in 70% ethanol solutions. The larval fish were then sorted by morphological features and identified to family taxonomic level where possible, referring to reference guides and expert help where appropriate [@Anonymous:1996td; @Leis:2000wu; @Neira:1998vy]. For our analysis the most abundant (greater than 100 captured) reef associated fish families were identified from the samples, which were the family groups Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. For ichthyoplankton, ontogenetic stages can be broadly defined by the beginning of the development of the caudal fin as the notochord bends upwards and fin rays start to develop. For this study we classified the fish into three broad categories of ontogenetic stage, i.e. preflexion, flexion, or postflexion (@fig:stages). Each fish was photographed using a calibrated stereo microscope and the standard length (SL) was measured to μm accuracy using the image acquisition software Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Insight 8.

## Data analysis

In order to evaluate the effect depth and oceanographic feature on OVM patterns I used general linear models (GLMs) with either length or abundance as the response variable (@tbl:models). A separate GLM was run for each of the seven families and the two response variables (fish size and fish stage). GLMs were constructed using a bottom-up approach, building models of single factors and including predicators that were significant until a complete model was constructed which represented the data . The model was then reduced where possible to exclude non-significant interaction predictors using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Water characteristics of temperature (°C), salinity (PSI), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Volts) values were calculated for the depth range covered by each net at each station and included in the model to explain variability associated with the specific location of each station within the broader region. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were highly correlated with each other (r^2^ = 0.73), and therefore only one was included in any model at a time, but both were tested for significance (@tbl:models). The stage-abundance data was analysed using a negative binomial distribution with an offset to standardise the abundance using concentration (1000 m^3^) per filtered volume of water per net calculated from the flowmeter. The negative binomial was chosen to account for the over-dispersion of the data. Even though the data contained a large number of zero observations, none of the models appeared to be zero-inflated after comparing the expected zeros of the negative binomial distribution fit to the data with zero-inflated negative binomial models. The larval fish length data were found to fit GLMs with a gamma distribution and log link function, probably due to sampling bias and high larval mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the GLMs were performed using pairwise tests on the least squares means with a Tukey adjustment. All analysis was conducted using the R programming language (R Core Team). The package MASS was used for negative binomial GLMs [CITE], the packages car [CITE] and DHARMa were used for model checking, and the packages lsmeans [CITE] and multcomp [CITE] were used for GLM post-hoc analysis. Figures and tables were made using the package tidyverse [CITE] and stargazer [CITE] respectively.

# Results

The seven reef associated families comprised of 2827 fish in total, of which 44.3% came from the family Labridae (@tbl:catch-summary). One surface tow at station 8 was not included in the analysis because there were no flowmeter readings to get concentration, and at station 16 the surface nets were not deployed due to rough conditions. There were differences in catches of ontogenetic stages, with some families such as Serranidae and Mullidae dominated by small preflexion larvae and  Labridae was dominated by postflexion larvae (@tbl:catch-summary). Pomacentridae and Scaridae had low samples of postflexion and preflexion respectively.

## Stage-abundance

![Mean concentration (1000 m^3^) of ontogenetic larval stages (PRE = preflexion, FLE = flexion, POS = postflexion) for seven temperate reef families (Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae) at three depths (0 = surface, 25 = 5-50 m, 75 = 51-100 m), sampled from 16 different stations along the NSW coast (95% confidence intervals are shown)](chapters/empirical/figs/depth-stage-all-point.png){#fig:ovm}

[Depth patterns]
Five of the seven reef associated families showed significant patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, Labridae, Mullidae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae, defined as an interaction of stage and depth on the concentration of larval fish (@fig:ovm; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The highest concentration of Labridae, Scorpaenidae, and Synodontidae larvae were found at 5-50 m. Pomacentridae, Mullidae, Scaridae and Serranidae larvae were most abundant at the surface and 5-50 m. Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Synodontidae, Serranidae larvae were found in low concentrations at 51-100 m, with only Labridae, Scaridae, and Scorpaenidae occurred in any notable numbers (greater than 1 1000m^-3^) below 50 m in the water column.

[Labridae]
Labridae larvae showed patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration to spread out deeper with flexion and to the surface with postflexion, as the proportion of postflexion and flexion larvae increased at 51-100 m, and postflexion increased at the surface. Labridae larvae were found to be in equal numbers at both the surface and 5-50 m (many postflexion larvae were found in the surface but with high variability; @fig:ovm). Preflexion Labridae larvae were in significantly lower numbers than both flexion (p < 0.001) and post-flexion (p < 0.001) at the deepest later, suggesting 50 m is the deepest as the preflexion larvae descend. These preflexion larvae preferred the middle depth, 2.4 times more abundant there than the surface (p = 0.020), and 9.2 times more abundant at 5-50 m than the deep layer (p < 0.001). The preflexion larvae were 3.8 times less abundant in the deep layer than the surface (p = 0.011) Labridae flexion larvae preferred the middle depth over the surface where they were found to be 2.5 times more abundant (p = 0.017). The postflexion larvae did not have a preference for any depth, seemingly expanding their range over the sampled 100 m.

[Mullidae]
Mullidae larvae ontogenetically migrated to the surface with post-flexion (@fig:ovm). Ontogenetic stages of the larvae at the surface were in equal abundances, however at 5-50 m preflexion larvae were 5.3 times more abundant than the postflexion larvae (p = 0.003) and at 51-100 m they were 9.2 times less abundant (p = 0.045). All three ontogenetic stages for Mullidae larvae were significantly more abundant at the surface and middle depth than the deepest depth.

[Scorpaenidae]
Scorpaenidae larvae showed strong downwards ontogenetic vertical migration (@fig:ovm). The preflexion larvae were 6 times more abundant than postflexion larvae at the surface (p = 0.044), in equal abundances to the other stages in the middle depth and 5.4 times less abundant then postflexion larvae at the deep depth (p = 0.030). Flexion and postflexion larvae were found in equal abundances at each depth, and both were found significantly higher numbers at the middle and deep depths compared to the surface. Preflexion larvae appeared to be more abundant at the surface and middle depths than the deep, but post-hoc tests did not find this to be significant.

[Serranidae]
Serranidae larvae showed downward ontogenetic vertical migration from preflexion, which were predominately in the top 50m, to the flexion and postflexion larvae which spread out evenly across the depths (@fig:ovm). At the surface and middle depths, each ontogenetic stage of Serranidae larvae occurred in significantly different abundances, preflexion larvae were the most abundant, and postflexion were the least abundant (@fig:ovm). In the deep layer, preflexion and flexion larvae occurred in equal highest abundances, and postflexion was the least abundant. Preflexion and flexion larvae were not found by the model to change in abundance between the depths, which does not appear to fit the data (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).

[Synodontidae]
The distribution of Synodontidae larvae suggested a downwards ontogenetic vertical migration, with preflexion larvae preferring the top 50m, but flexion and postflexion larvae eschewing the surface waters. Synodontidae preflexion larvae were found in higher abundances in the surface, 6.1 times more abundant than postflexion larvae (p = 0.018). In all other depths, the stages occurred in equal abundances, suggesting a preference for preflexion larvae of shallower depths than older larvae which are found 5-100m.

[Scaridae & Pomacentridae]
Pomacentridae and Scaridae did not show patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, both were found in similar proportions at each depth (@fig:ovm). Pomacentridae larvae were found in equal abundances of preflexion and non-preflexion larvae (flexion and postflexion was combined due to low sample sizes; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-pom). There was an effect of depth at 75 m, significantly reducing the overall abundance (p < 0.001). For Scaridae larvae, the concentration in the 25 m layer was 3.1 times greater than the surface (p = 0.004). The large variation of larvae concentrations at 75 m meant it was found to not be different to either 25 m or the surface, even though the mean was higher overall. At each depth, flexion and postflexion were found in higher abundance than preflexion.

[Environmental data]
The abundance of Labridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, and Synodontidae were all strongly positively predicted with temperature (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), whereas Pomacentridae were negatively predicted by temperature (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-pom). Chlorophyll fluorescence was negatively associated with abundance for both Pomacentridae and Mullidae. Increasing levels of dissolved oxygen predicted increasing abundance of Labridae. Salinity was a negative predictor of Scaridae abundance.

[Feature]
Labridae occurred in equal abundances in the coastal waters, but in the eddy, preflexion larvae were the least abundant, followed by flexion (p~preflexion-flexion~ = 0.016) and postflexion (p~preflexion-postflexion~ < 0.001; p~flexion-postflexion~ < 0. 001) was the most abundant (@fig:depth-stage-feature). Scorpaenidae flexion larvae abundance increased 5.7 times (p < 0.001) and postflexion larvae 9.5 times (p < 0.001) in the eddy compared to the coastal waters, while preflexion abundance did not vary. Flexion larvae of Synodontidae were more common in the eddy (p = 0.003). In the coastal waters, Labridae was more abundant at 25 m than the surface, but in the Eddy both the surface and 25 m was more abundant than 75 m (p~0m~ = 0.010; p~25m~ < 0.001). Total Synodontidae abundance increased in the eddy 4.9 times at 25 m, when compared to the coastal waters.

For five of the seven fish families, depth was a significant predictor of length and there was no interaction between depth and feature (@tbl:length-glm-output). Three families (Pomacentridae, Scorpaenidae, and Serranidae) showed increasing length with depth (@fig:length-depth). Serranidae showed the clearest pattern, significantly increasing in size at each depth. Pomacentridae were significantly longer below the surface (p~5-50~ = 0.0215, p~51-100~ = 0.0146). Scorpaenidae were  longest in the deep water, 1.5 times longer than the surface (p < 0.001), and 1.2 times longer than the middle depth (p = 0.001). No differences in length between the surface and middle depth layer for Scorpaenidae larvae were found (@fig:length-depth). Mullidae and Labridae larvae were smallest in the 5-50 m depth layer and longer at depth 51-100 m than the surface waters. Scaridae and Synodontidae showed no differences in size between any of the three depths.

[Feature]
Six of the families were significantly longer in an eddy than the coastal waters, Scaridae being the exception where the eddy had no effect on length (@fig:length-feature). The greatest effect of eddy was on Mullidae, which were on average predicted to be 3.7 times longer than the larvae in the coastal waters (p < 0.001) and the smallest effect was on Labridae which were only 1.2 times longer (p < 0.001; @tbl:length-glm-output).

[Environmental variables]
The length of Labridae (p < 0.001), Pomacentridae (p < 0.001) and Serranidae (p < 0.001) all decreased in length with increasing water temperature suggesting the longer fish go deeper (@fig:length-temp; @tbl:length-glm-output), while Mullidae increased length with warming waters as longer fish are found in the surface (p < 0.001). Only Labridae larvae length changed with chlorophyll, minimally decreasing with increasing levels (p < 0.001; @fig:length-chloro). Increasing salinity was associated with longer Scaridae (p = 0.002), but predicted shorter Pomacentridae (p = 0.004) and Scorpaenidae larvae (p = 0.039; @fig:length-salt). Shorter Pomacentridae larvae were found with decreasing dissolved oxygen levels (p = 0.008; @fig:length-do).

# Discussion

Your trends for family may be confounded by within family variation.
Is there a family (Miskie?) that you could test this with a couple of taxa even simply by inspection, before graduating to a family level statistical analysis?

Secondly – is the thermocline approximately around 50 m for most of the stations? Or is it significantly different?  I think it was – but if not then it would confound the effect of depth (ie the taxon follows the water mass)

## Stage-abundance
Ontogenetic stage distribution patterns were not seen amongst all of the families as predicted, and of the five families that show ontogenetic shifts in distribution, a downward shift pattern was not uniform. Similar downward ontogenetic shifts of the families Labridae, Scorpaenidae and Serranidae as seen in this study, have been seen before [@Gray:1993et; @Irisson:2010um]. Off the NSW coast, a study of vertical migration also saw upwards shifts for Mullidae and no ontogenetic pattern for Pomacentridae [@Gray:1993et]. Pomacentridae in tropical areas have been shown to vertically migrate both downwards [@Paris:2004te] and upwards [@Irisson:2010um] with ontogeny, suggesting strong species-specific trends. In our experiment, the results for Pomacentridae and Scaridae were also hard to analyse due to the low sample numbers for postflexion and preflexion respectively, therefore it is highly possible ontogenetic patterns existed but we could not tease them out. The result was surprising, as we thought the relationship between stage and depth would exist for these families as per the literature, especially over the coarse depths we used. For Scorpaenidae, X and Y, the pattern supported our hypothesis that more developed larvae (in this case flexion and onwards) were more likely to be present at lower depths (50-100 m). For the other species, it appears there could be ontogenetic patterns, but the low catch rate of the different ontogenetic stages across all sites reduced the power of the analysis.

## Length
Our hypothesis that fish would increase in size with depth was clearly supported in the families Mullidae, Scorpaenidae and Serranidae and partially supported by Pomacentridae (longer at 5-50 m than the surface) and Labridae (longest at 50-100 m). Synodontidae also showed a trend of being longer at 50-100 m, but it was non-significant. The fish larvae at 50-100 m were also often 2-3 times longer than the other depths, suggesting much older larvae are found in the deeper waters. It has been argued that such a pattern can be seen because that older, larger fish have an increased range due to developmental swimming ability, and it is more of a uniform distribution at different length classes than the results suggest [@Irisson:2010um].

## Contrast
Four of the families (Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae and Scorpaenidae) supported our hypothesis, exhibiting the same vertical distribution pattern for both length and stage abundance. However , three of the families had divergent patterns for each of the response variables. Pomacentridae was found to get longer between the surface and 25 m, yet no ontogenic differences were found between the depths. This result is most likely explained by the low number of postflexion Pomacentridae larvae sampled at the 5-50 m depth. Serranidae were found to be longer at 25 m than the surface, but there were no differences in the abundances of ontogenetic stages. Synodontidae had the opposite result, with ontogenetic changes between depths, but no differences in length.

[Environmental Factors]
Environmental factors were also driving the differences in larval abundance, complicating the reasons for the patterns of vertical migration. As environmental variables were a proxy for site, it explains some of the patchiness in larval fish assemblages seen between sites. Although it has been shown that ichthyoplankton distributions are inherently patchy [@Gray:1993et; @Cowen1993uv], with temperature, salinity, light, tide, flow all influencing assemblages [CITE Leis 2006]. Adding to the complexity is that these factors can also interact, such that each single factor has been seen to explain only a small amount of the variability of assemblages [@Cowen1993uv]. [TALK ABOUT IN CONTEXT OF FEATURE] Temperature had the strongest effect, seen to predict both abundance and length for several families. It was an especially strong predictor of length in Mullidae, which is not surprising given that many post-flexion are found in warm surface waters. This was in general a positive relationship, except for Pomacentridae which were less abundant with increasing temperature, but longer. It could be that there was a mix of tropical and temperate species within each of the sampled families, driving differences in abundance by temperature. Salinity was only a positive predictor of Scaridae abundance, but was a significant predictor of length in four of the families. Dissolved oxygen positively predicted the abundance of Mullidae and Serranidae, suggesting that ichthyoplankton migrate to areas of increased phytoplankton for feeding. However, this relationship was not consistent, with lower Pomacentridae abundance negatively associated with dissolved oxygen.

## Feature
We predicted that older and longer larvae would be found in the eddy waters compared to the coastal waters, but we only found the pattern of longer larvae to be consistent (occurring in all but one family). Increased abundance of postflexion larvae was only seen in two families, even though longer larvae were found - suggesting that the water feature has more of an effect on the size of the larvae compared to the development. Interestingly no interactions with feature were found, suggesting that patterns of vertical migration are not impacted by the associated water feature that are in.

## Limitations and future directions

[Integrate these two paragraphs]
 A significant drawback of this method is that these towed studies capture fewer postflexion larvae due to increased net avoidance abilities [CITE Leis 2006].  To measure development you can either measure the ontogeny by depth, classifying the larval fish to ontogenetic stage or using the larval length. In this study we measured both developmental stage and length to determine which pattern showed clearer ontogenetic vertical migration.

There were several limitations in the experimental design of this study, as denoted in the literature; the main drawback is that nets cannot measure the larval behaviour and only provide information on the distribution [CITE Pearce 1979]. To measure the behaviour, another method is to obtain vertical migration distributions through observation using divers [CITE Leis 2009]. This method does measure actual behaviour but it is limited by the amount of time divers can spend in the water and how deep they can safely go to make observations, and cannot be done over the depths and spatial scales used in this study. The traditional net sampling method most likely under-sampled postflexion larvae for several of the families due to the ability to evade the nets (@tbl:catch-summary; CITE Leis 2006). Although not only gear avoidance contributes to this under sampling, high larval mortality leads to over representation of younger fish making a balanced sampling design difficult. Another limitation was the coarseness of the depth ranges used, only sampling the surface waters, 5-50 m, and 51-100 m layers does not allow for finer ontogenetic vertical migration distributional patterns to be captured. Ontogenetic vertical migration it has been argued is a moderate adjustment in the water column and not stratification [CITE Huebert 2011], which is more difficult to capture using our coarser depth scales. It would also be useful to sample for vertical distributions patterns during over different temporal scales, from day/night time scales to seasonal scales and to test the consistency of these ontogenetic vertical distributions. The difficulty is in the cost of sampling by tows is increased over spatial and temporal scales. As a general rule, oceanographic sampling studies suffer from issues over under sampling at both the spatial scale (only 16 stations), and the ability to measure all of the factors affecting assemblages in the water column.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, ontogenetic vertical migration is not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, and fish that do exhibit ontogenetic vertical migration can display contrasting patterns. Even when vertical patterns do exist, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also effect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change these ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.
