# Do temperate reef ichthyoplankton in NSW exhibit patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration, and does it change for ichthyoplankton entrained in eddies?

## Introduction

Ichthyoplankton are generally hatched from eggs with limited behavioural capabilities, but with the onset of ontogenetic development, increase their competency to swim, sense and orientate over a relatively short period of time (days to weeks; @Leis:2006kf]. Historically, larval dispersal was thought to be driven predominately by the ocean currents and dependent on the length of pelagic larval duration and the currents, and other effects being negligible due to the weak swimming ability of larvae [@Williams:1984il]. Subsequently we have found out that behaviour plays a big part in the dispersal of ichthyoplankton, changing vertical position in the water column increases local retention [@Paris:2007hm] , they can sustain horizontal swimming speeds greater than the prevailing currents [@Leis:2006we; @Fisher:2000kn] and sense settlement habitat [using senses to detect water chemistry, sound, and visual cues; @KingsfordSensoryenvironmentslarval2002]. In combination, these factors enable larvae to choose between reefs, i.e. search for higher quality habitat or a preference to settle close to the natal reef [@JonesCoralreeffish2005; @Gerlach:2007gw]. Behavioural traits influencing dispersal are particularly important for adult sessile fish, where the major mode of dispersal is through its pelagic larval phase.

Vertical migration is one such behaviour, through two mechanisms; either ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM; vertical position of the larvae changes with ontogeny) or diel vertical migration (DVM; vertical position of the larvae changes with the diurnal pattern of the sun), that allows for the indirect influence of dispersal via diverging current velocities in the water column [@Paris:2004te]. The ability of larvae to regulate their depth from the time of hatching, is independent of the ability to sense, orientate and swim, behaviours that develop later in life [@Leis:2010jz]. The vertical distribution patterns of larval fish are well represented in the literature, both diel vertical migration [@Lampert:1989ww] and ontogenetic vertical migration [@GronkjaerOntogeneticenvironmentaleffects1997]. The vertical distribution of larval fish is more structured during the day compared with night, therefore the distributional changes are clearer with DVM [@Leis:1991kl]. The evolutionary utility of vertical migration is generally thought to involve reduced mortality due to predator avoidance [especially visual predators in the case of diel vertical migration; @Lampert:1989ww]. It has also been suggested that vertical migration may provide metabolic advantages based allowing ichthyoplankton to change their thermal environment [@Wurtsbaugh:1988cg] and that it can facilitate directed horizontal movement where current direction varies with depth, either through physical processes such as consequences of the Coriolis effect [@Sponaugle:2002vg] or by selective tidal transport in and out of estuaries [@Hare:2005kc]. Understanding this behaviour, that in turn affects dispersal and population connectivity, is important in a world of changing ocean dynamics due to environmental and anthropogenic changes changes.

This study focuses on investigating the ontogenetic vertical migration of larval reef fish in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which through connectivity modelling studies has been shown to be important for influencing dispersal patterns [@Paris:2007hm; @HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011]. In general, patterns and causation of OBM are not well understood, although it has been suggested the centre of mass of larval reef fish gets deeper in the water column with ontogeny [@Paris:2004te; @Irisson:2010um]. Even species specific patterns are relatively unknown, as ontogenetic vertical patterns are not consistent, varying between species, within species and over spatial contexts [@Leis:2010jz]. Therefore to understand the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish, localised studies are required to determine the vertical migration patterns. Previously only the relationship between length and depth for common species off Sydney has been investigated [@Gray:1993et], comparing the surfaces waters to deeper in the waters column (changing depending on off-shore distance), as well as looking at the diel vertical migration of preflexion and postflexion larval fish off Sydney [@Gray:1998wk]

Understanding the early-life history of larval fish is important for parameterising biophysical models, reducing the amount of assumptions improves the accuracy of a model [@Leis:2007jh]. Vertical migration behaviour is considered especially important off the eastern coast of Australia, where complex ocean conditions, e.g. complex coastline with a narrow continental shelf and a strong near-shore boundary current (the East Australian Current, EAC), therefore vertical position can potentially have a strong influence on dispersal in the region. The EAC often spawns warm-core and cold-core eddies off the coast of New South Wales at any latitude, concentrated below 32°S [@Everett:2012bj] and these eddies entrain continental shelf waters, bringing with them both pelagic eggs and newly hatch larval fish and providing nutrient rich environments for them to develop and potentially reducing predation [@ShulzitskiCloseencounterseddies2015a; @MullaneyEntrainmentretentioncoastal2013b]. Simulation studies have shown that eddy speed, fish swimming speed [@Chang:2017bq], and the vertical distribution of fish [@Condie:2016kz] can influence the retention time within an eddy. However, to my knowledge no studies have empirically investigated how eddies effect the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of larval fish.

In this study I investigated the vertical distribution of larvae in different oceanographic features (eddy versus no-eddy) off the coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia using depth-stratified plankton tows. Here it must be noted that the sampling method only infers the vertical distribution and does not inform about the specific behaviour leading to these patterns (CITE). My aim was to determine the ontogenetic patterns of vertical distribution of temperate reef fish families off NSW (estimated both by fish length and ontogenetic stage), and if the nature of these patterns are dependent on the surrounding oceanography (presence of an eddy or not). I expected that reef fish larvae entrained in eddies will be both further developed and longer within eddies than coastal waters, but did not expect their depth distribution patterns to be fundamentally different to those fish found outside the eddies.

## Methods

Sampling occurred along the eastern coast of Australia on Australian Marine National Facility's RV _Investigator_ (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2013_V03). We sampled 16 stations across two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC; @fig:stations]. The location of the frontal eddies were calculated onboard using real time data and novel techniques [@Roughan:2017hh]. At each station we sampled for larval fish using two different net types, a Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) and a Neuston net. Both nets had a 1 m^2^ mouth area and 500 μm mesh. The MOCNESS system sampled over two different depth ranges, 5-50 m and 50-100 m, conducting two 10-minute tows over each depth range. The Neuston net captured larval fish at the near surface level (0-5 m) and was deployed for two 10-minute tows per station. In total there were two tows at each depth per station. Neuston and MOCNESS nets were deployed at the same time and all tows were conducted between sunset and sunrise to remove any confounding effect of diel vertical migration. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, including dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were taken on the MOCNESS net at each station. Each net had a flow sensor, enabling concentrations of larval fish per cubic metre to be calculated. For each sample pair per station, each sample was preserved in 10% buffered formalin solution. But for one sample per net, larger fish that could be easily identified in the sample by eye were removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 70% ethanol solution in case genetic or otolith analysis was required later on some of the larval fish. In total, 36.4% of the ichthyoplankton was preserved in ethanol, with a slight bias towards postflexion fish (postflexion fish made up 59.0% of the ichthyoplankton preserved in ethanol and only 20.7% of the fish preserved in formalin). The ad hoc selection process for ethanol preservation occurred at all stations. Both samples were used in the analyses and no correction for shrinkage was made for the ethanol samples. Therefore the measurements of postflexion larvae could be bias towards under measurement of length (the exact level of shrinkage is species specific; CITE paper), but we did not compare across groups and the effect on the results is predicted to be minimal.

### Data processing

In the lab each zooplankton sample was sorted to seperate out the ichthyoplankton. The samples were rinsed to remove excess formalin and preserved in 70% ethanol solutions. The larval fish were then sorted by morphological features and identified to family taxonomic level where possible, referring to reference guides and expert help where appropriate [@Moserearlystagesfishes1996 @Leis:2000wu; @Neira:1998vy]. For our analysis the most abundant (greater than 100 captured) reef associated fish families were identified from the samples, which were the family groups: Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. For ichthyoplankton, ontogenetic stages can be broadly defined by the beginning of the development of the caudal fin as the notochord bends upwards and fin rays start to develop. For this study we classified the fish into three broad categories of ontogenetic stage, i.e. preflexion, flexion, or postflexion (@fig:stages). Each fish was photographed using a calibrated stereo microscope and the standard length (SL) was measured to μm accuracy using the image acquisition software Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Insight Version 8.

### Data analysis

In order to evaluate the effect depth and oceanographic feature on OVM patterns I used general linear models (GLMs) with either length or abundance as the response variable (@tbl:models). A separate GLM was constructed for each of the seven families and the two response variables (fish size and fish stage), using the independent factors of feature (levels: eddy or coastal), depth (levels: 0-5, 5-50, 51-100 m). The fish stage data was analysed with concentration (1000 m^3^) as the response variable and using stage (levels: preflexion, flexion, postflexion) as a factor. Water characteristics of temperature (°C), salinity (PSI), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Volts) values were calculated for the depth range covered by each net at each station and included in the model to explain variability associated with the specific location of each station within the broader region. For each family, GLMs were initially constructed using a bottom-up approach (using what I called the base model; @tbl:models), including each possible predictor variable and then using Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection to remove non-significant predictors until a model with the maximum significant predictors and lowest possible AIC was identified (CITE: Reference a book?). Reduced models were only considered if they were significantly different from each other using ANOVA tests. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence were highly correlated with each other (r^2^ = 0.73), and therefore only one was included in any model at a time, but both were tested for significance separately (@tbl:models). The stage-abundance data was analysed using a negative binomial distribution with an offset to standardise the abundance using concentration (1000 m^3^; the offset allows us to use our concentration measurements on the discrete negative binomial distribution) per filtered volume of water per net calculated from the flowmeter. The negative binomial distribution was chosen to account for the over-dispersion of the data due to the high number of zeros. Despite the large number of zero observations, no models were considered to be zero-inflated after comparing the expected zeros of the data with a negative binomial model and a zero-inflated negative binomial model [CITE book]. The larval fish length data was fitted with GLMs using a gamma distribution and log link function, most likely due to sampling bias and high larval mortality, but common for fish length data [CITE]. Post-hoc analysis of the GLMs were performed using pairwise tests on the least squares means with a Tukey adjustment. All analysis was conducted using the R programming language (R Core Team). The package MASS was used for negative binomial GLMs [CITE], the packages car [CITE] and DHARMa [CITE] were used for model checking, and the packages lsmeans [CITE] and multcomp [CITE] were used for GLM post-hoc analysis.

## Results

The seven reef associated families comprised of 2827 fish in total, of which 44.3% came from the family Labridae (@tbl:catch-summary). One surface tow at station 8 was not included in the analysis because there were no flowmeter readings from which to get concentration, and at station 16 the surface nets were not deployed due to rough conditions. There were differences in catches of ontogenetic stages, with some families such as Serranidae and Mullidae dominated by small preflexion larvae and Labridae was dominated by postflexion larvae (@tbl:catch-summary). Pomacentridae and Scaridae had low samples of postflexion and preflexion respectively. For Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae, and Scorpaenidae, more than 65% of the larvae were sampled from water within an eddy.

### Ontogenetic vertical migration patterns

Six of the seven fish families exhibited patterns of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM using either length or stage-abundance as a response variable; @tbl:ovm-summary). Labridae, Mullidae, Scorpaenidae, and Serranidae saw patterns for both length and stage-abundance. OVM patterns were only seen for one of the variables in the families Pomacentridae (length) and Synodontidae (stage-abundance). Scaridae did not exhibit any changes in depth with ontogeny.

|---------------|-----|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Labridae      | Yes | ↑↓ : 25 < 0 < 75 | ↓ : flexion (↓), postflexion (-)  |
| Mullidae      | Yes | ↑↓ : 25 < 0 < 75 | ↓↑ : flexion (-), postflexion (↓↑) |
| Pomacentridae | Yes | ↓ : 0 < 25 = 75  | -                                 |
| Scaridae      | No  | -                | -                                 |
| Scorpaenidae  | Yes | ↓ : 0 = 25 < 75  | ↓ : flexion (↓), postflexion (↓)  |
| Serranidae    | Yes | ↓ : 0 < 25 < 75  | ↓ : flexion (↓), postflexion (-)  |
| Synodontidae  | Yes | -                | ↓ : flexion (↓), postflexion (-)  |

For five of the seven fish families, depth was a significant predictor of length (@tbl:ovm-summary). Two distinct patterns were seen, either moving downwards (↓) with increasing length or moving upwards and the downwards with increasing length (↑↓; @fig:length-depth). Labridae and Mullidae exhibited the latter pattern of OVM, migrating upwards and the downwards. Larvae were smallest at 25 m, increasing length at the surface waters, and the largest fish were found in the 75m. Pomacentridae larvae migrated downwards, found smallest in the surface waters, there was no difference in length between 25 and 75 m. Scorpaenidae larvae migrated downwards with length, found to be the same size in the surface and 25 m depths, but longer at 75 m. Different length Serranidae were found in each depth, migrating downwards in length from the smallest in the surface to 75m. For Scaridae or Synodontidae larvae there were no differences in lengths between depths.

Five families showed patterns of OVM when considering stage-abundance at depths, with significant interactions between ontogenetic stage and depth (@tbl:ovm-summary). Again two patterns were found, either an overall downwards migration from preflexion or an bidirectional migration during postflexion (↓↑; @fig:ovm). Scorpaenidae larvae migrated downwards during both flexion and postflexion (@tbl:ovm-summary). Labridae, Serranidae and Synodontidae larvae migrated downwards during flexion, but the depths did not change during postflexion. Mullidae larvae migrated both downwards towards 75 m and towards the surface during postflexion. Pomacentridae and Synodontidae ichthyoplankton did not change depths with ontogeny.

### Effect of feature

Feature (eddy or coastal waters) did not appear to influence the patterns of OVM, as there was no significant interaction of feature on the prediction of either length or abundance (@tbl:length-glm-output, @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). The larval fish in general, were more abundant and longer inside eddies than coastal water (@tbl:length-glm-output, @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Scaridae larvae were the only ichthyoplankton found to be the same length across water features (@fig:length-feature).

### Water characteristics

Temperature was the common predictor of both abundance (significant for five families) and length (significant for four families) of the sampled larval fish, although the direction of the effect was not consistent across families (@tbl:water-summary). Salinity predicted abundance in one family, Scaridae larvae, but predicted the length in three families (negative predictor for Pomacentridae and Scaridae, positive predictor for Scorpaenidae). Dissolved oxygen predicted the abundance of Scaridae (negative) and Serranidae (positive), and only had an effect on the length of Pomacentridae (positive). In a similar trend, chlorophyll fluorescence was a negative predictor of abundance for Mullidae and Pomacentridae larvae, and only a negative predictor for the length of Labridae.

### Family summaries

#### Labridae

The length distribution of Labridae larvae was driven by shorter larvae at 25 m, while in the observed data the Labridae larvae did not appear to be larger at 75 m (@fig:length-depth), the predicted model had the larvae significantly larger at 75 m (p < 0.001; @tbl:length-glm-output).
The downwards OVM pattern for Labridae larvae was driven by decreasing abundance of preflexion larvae to flexion larvae at 75 m depth, occurring in equal numbers at the other depths (@fig:ovm). Labridae postflexion larvae were found in high concentrations at the surface waters, there was high variability between stations. The effect of feature was to increasing abundance in eddies, specifically the abundance of postflexion (6.25 times) and flexion (1.7 times; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), and to increase the length of larvae in eddies to 1.14 times that of coastal water (@tbl:length-glm-output). The effect of environmental variables on the abundance (temperature) and length (temperature and chlorophyll) were small (@fig:length-temp; @fig:length-chloro).

#### Mullidae

The OVM pattern from length data suggested Mullidae larvae started at 25 m, migrated upwards to the surface until they reached the length of 7.5 mm and then downwards to 75 m (@fig:length-depth). The OVM pattern of the stage-abundance data was driven by postflexion larvae found at the surface and 75 m (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output; @fig:ovm). All three stages were rare at 75 m, however, postflexion significantly higher in concentration than preflexion larvae at 75 m (p = 0.045). In contrast, postflexion larvae were significantly lower than preflexion larvae at 25 m (p = 0.0025), and there was no difference in concentrations at the surface. All three ontogenetic stages of Mullidae larvae were found in significantly higher numbers in eddy compared to coastal waters, however preflexion larvae were 15.9 times more abundant (p < 0.001; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output). Increasing temperature  had a small positive effect on the length of Mullidae larvae (@fig:length-temp; @tbl:length-glm-output).

#### Pomacentridae

The OVM pattern seen by length of Pomacentridae larvae with depth was an increase of length from the surface waters to 25 m (p = 0.017) and 75 m (p = 0.008; @fig:length-depth; @tbl:length-glm-output). Stage-abundance did not show OVM patterns (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-pom), however, there was an effect of feature on the concentration at depth with larvae 2.1 times more abundant in the eddy than coastal waters at 25 m. Pomacentridae larvae were rarely found at the 75 m depth (@fig:ovm), and temperature was found to have a negative effect on both the length and concentration of larvae (@fig:length-temp). Pomacentridae length was also negatively predicted by salinity (@fig:length-salt). and positively predicted by dissolved oxygen (@fig:length-do).

#### Scaridae

No patterns of OVM were seen for Scaridae larvae (@fig:length-depth; @fig:ovm). Preflexion larvae were sampled in low numbers across all depths, and flexion and postflexion were in the highest abundance at 25 m. Salinity was the strongest predictor of length, with increases in salinity associated with shorter larvae (@tbl:length-glm-output).

#### Scorpaenidae

Scorpaenidae larvae showed strong downwards OVM patterns with stage-abundance (@fig:ovm; @tbl:ontogeny-glm-output), driven by preflexion larvae that occurred in high abundances at the surface and 25m, flexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at 25 m, and postflexion larvae that occurred in high abundance at 25 and 75 m. The length relationship with depth showed the same downwards pattern, but it was not as defined, with the large increase in length occurring at 75 m (@fig:length-depth). Flexion and postflexion larvae were found at increased concentrations in the eddy, 5.8 times and 10.4 respectively (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).

#### Serranidae

Serranidae larvae showed downward ontogenetic vertical migration from preflexion, which were predominately in the top 50 m, to the flexion and postflexion larvae which spread out evenly across the depths (@fig:ovm). At the surface and middle depths, each ontogenetic stage of Serranidae larvae occurred in significantly different abundances, preflexion larvae were the most abundant, and postflexion were the least abundant (@fig:ovm). In the deep layer, preflexion and flexion larvae occurred in equal highest abundances, and postflexion was the least abundant. Preflexion and flexion larvae were not found by the model to change in abundance between the depths, which does not appear to fit the data (@tbl:ontogeny-glm-output).

#### Synodontidae
Synodontidae were observed to migrate downwards with stage-abundance from preflexion to flexion (@fig:ovm), but with no significant patterns seen with larval length (@fig:length-depth). Synodontidae larvae were the longest larvae sampled, eddy had the strongest effect of all families, found to be on average 30% longer than in the coastal waters (@fig:length-feature). The only environmental variable that significantly predicted abundance was temperature (@tbl:water-summary).

## Discussion

### Vertical migration patterns
In six of the seven families, either older or longer larvae were found deeper, supporting our hypothesis — Scaridae was the only family of fish to not show any migration pattern over the 100 m. Similar results were found with coral reef fish larvae, suggesting while there was an overall trend downwards of the centre of mass, it was driven by an increase in the spread of larval fish in the water column with ontogeny [@Irisson:2010um]. In contrast to our results, a study off NSW found larval fish did not show any changes in vertical distribution with ontogeny [@Gray:1998wk]. The six different migrating families exhibited two distributions; either a downwards migration with ontogeny or a migration where larvae showed bi-directional migration with ontogeny. Suggesting larvae reaching flexion and post-flexion ontogenetic stages have a greater ability to vertically migrate throughout the water column. The same pattern was not always seen in both length or stage-abundance, although this seemed to be driven by the high variability in stage-abundance reducing statistical power and not by contrasting patterns.

Labridae larvae have been shown to not change their vertical position with ontogeny [@Gray:1998wk; @Cowen:2002wb], or to migrate downwards with ontogeny [@Irisson:2010um; @HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011]. This study found Labridae larvae to also migrate downwards with ontogeny, with the distinction from previous studies that longer larvae were also found at the surface. When considering larval length, the distribution of Labridae predicted that longer larvae were in the surface than 25 m, yet stage-abundance did not capture this relationship, instead suggesting Labridae larvae move downwards with ontogenetic stage. Although, this is most likely to the high variability of postflexion larvae found in the surface between stations. Not considering ontogeny, a previous study off the NSW coastline found Mullidae larvae were common at the surface and rare at 20 m [@Gray:1993et]. Similar patterns were seen here, with preflexion and flexion larvae concentrated in the surface (flexion larvae also migrated downwards to 25 m). However, we found postflexion larvae to be abundant at the surface and 25 m. Mullidae larvae are considered surface dwelling [@McCormick:1993hc; @Uiblein:2007em], a possible explanation for the increased vertical distribution seen in our results is that at the depth 25 m (range 5-50 m) many larval fish caught closer to the top of this range than the bottom. Pomacentridae larvae have been shown to both migrate vertically downward with ontogeny [@Paris:2004te] or upwards [@Irisson:2010um], suggesting species heterogeneity. While no stage-abundance vertical migration was was seen in the results, larvae were found to be longer at 25 and 75 m than the surface waters. The low sample size of postflexion Pomacentridae larvae most likely contributed to the non-significance of the results. Scaridae larvae have been seen to migrate downwards with increasing length [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011], however these results showed no change in their vertical distribution when considering length or stage-abundance. Partially explained by the low sample size of smaller preflexion Scaridae larvae, contributed to any non-significant findings. Scorpaenidae showed the strongest structured patterns of vertical distribution, interestingly other studies saw no changes in vertical distribution [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011] or Scorpaenidae larvae concentrated towards the surface and were rarely found below 50 m [@Kuwahara:1983hg]. Serranidae significantly migrated downwards from preflexion considering both length and stage-abundance, patterns that have been previously seen elsewhere [@Irisson:2010um; @HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011]. Synodontidae larvae did show vertical patterns with length, but stage-abundance showed a downwards trend. Several Synodontidae larvae caught at the surface were well developed and much longer than other surface larvae, which potentially have masked patterns of a downwards shift. No studies on the changes in vertical distribution of Synodontidae larvae could be found to support these results, but they are considered to be rare at the surface, contrasting our results with a high abundance of preflexion larvae in the surface [@Leis:1991kl].

### Ontogenetic vertical migration
Ontogenetic shifts downwards in vertical distribution may occur for a number of reasons. Larvae may utilise the faster wind-driven surface currents with different strategies, migrating downwards to increase chances of local retention [@Paris:2004te] or migrating upwards for assisted dispersal, i.e. in the case of slower preflexion larvae. Turbulent surface waters have also been seen to induce ontogenetic shifts in vertical distribution, with preflexion larvae migrating away from turbulent waters [@HernandezEvaluatingdielontogenetic2009]. Changes in ontogeny can induce changes in metabolic needs, and potential new prey can have different vertical distributions [@Irisson:2010um]. Different patterns between taxa can be driven the differences in diets [@Llopiz:2009cc].

Pooling larvae into taxa at the family level, has the potential to mask divergent species specific patterns and therefore confounded the results. The decision was made to increase sample size, and due to the difficulty and time constraints of identifying species without genetic analysis. It also provides a relevant starting point for modellers requiring early-life history information on vertical distribution patterns of larval fish. Also the sampling approach used cannot measure the larval behaviour and only provide information on the distribution [@PearreJr:1979gu]. To measure the behaviour, another method is to obtain vertical migration distributions through observation using divers [@Leis:2010jz]. This method does measure actual behaviour but it is limited by the amount of time divers can spend in the water and how deep they can safely go to make observations, and cannot be done over the depths and spatial scales used in this study. The traditional net sampling method most likely under-sampled postflexion larvae for several of the families due to the ability to evade the nets [@tbl:catch-summary; @Leis:2006kf] Although not only gear avoidance contributes to this under sampling, high larval mortality leads to over representation of younger fish making a balanced sampling design difficult. Nevertheless, changes in patterns of vertical migration were identified. Alternative hypotheses are that the vertical range of fish increases with ontogeny, allowing individuals to move more, rather than wholesale ontogenetic shifts [@Irisson:2010um]. @Irisson:2010um also suggested the observed patterns could be due to larval mortality. If predation differed with depth and changed with ontogenetic stage or length, similar changes in patterns of vertical distribution might be seen.

### Effects of feature
As hypothesised, there was no effect of eddy on the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns when compared to the coastal waters. The reef fish ichthyoplankton for the studied taxa are known to be commonly found within the top 100 m of the water column [CITE], and the thermocline depth did not change between coastal water and the eddies sampled. It was predicted that older and longer larvae would be found in the eddy waters compared to the coastal waters as growth rates are seen to increase inside an eddy and improving survivorship [@ShulzitskiCloseencounterseddies2015a; @ShulzitskiEncountermesoscaleeddies2016a]. The length of the larval fish was increased inside the eddies, with the exception of Scaridae, and that is most likely a result of small sample size of postflexion larvae. Entrainment of larval fish within eddies is a well understood phenomena, limiting dispersal and allowing for local retention [@ReissObservationslarvalfish2000]. Similar increases in larval length have been seen in mesoscale eddies off NSW for sardine larvae [@MullaneyEntrainmentretentioncoastal2013b]. Increased abundance of postflexion larvae was only seen in two families, even though longer larvae were found - suggesting that the water feature has more of an effect on the size of the larvae compared to the development. An alternative explanation is that regular spawning of reef fish larvae leads to continued entrainment of preflexion larvae into the eddies, reducing any noticeable effect of stage-abundance.

### Environmental variation
Environmental factors were also driving the differences in larval abundance. The environmental variables measured explained some of the patchiness in larval fish assemblages seen between sites, of which there was high variation. Although it has been shown that ichthyoplankton distributions are inherently patchy [@Gray:1993et; @Cowenhydrographycanphysical1993], with temperature, salinity, light, tide, flow all influencing assemblages @Leis:2006kf Adding to the complexity is that these factors can also interact, such that each single factor has been seen to explain only a small amount of the variability of assemblages [@Cowenhydrographycanphysical1993]. Temperature had the strongest effect, seen to predict both abundance and length for several families. A strong positive effect of temperature was seen most strongly in Mullidae, which can explain by the preflexion and postflexion commonly found in the warmer surface waters. In general, increasing temperature was a positive predictor of abundance, Pomacentridae were the exception with an inverse pattern observed. Salinity was only a positive predictor of Scaridae abundance, but was a significant predictor of length in four of the families. Dissolved oxygen positively predicted the abundance of Mullidae and Serranidae, suggesting that ichthyoplankton migrate to areas of increased phytoplankton for feeding. However, this relationship was not consistent, with lower Pomacentridae abundance negatively associated with dissolved oxygen.


### Limitations and future directions
One limitation of the study was the coarseness of the depth ranges used, only sampling the surface waters, 5-50 m, and 51-100 m layers does not allow for finer ontogenetic vertical migration distributional patterns to be captured. Ontogenetic vertical migration it has been argued is a moderate adjustment in the water column and not stratification [@HuebertVerticalmigrationsreef2011], which is more difficult to capture using our coarser depth scales. It would also be useful to sample for vertical distributions patterns during over different temporal scales, from day/night time scales to seasonal scales and to test the consistency of these ontogenetic vertical distributions. The difficulty is in the cost of sampling by tows is increased over spatial and temporal scales. As a general rule, oceanographic sampling studies suffer from issues over under sampling at both the spatial scale (only 16 stations), and the ability to measure all of the factors affecting assemblages in the water column. Future studies should involve more stratified sampling, sampling across different time frames to detect seasonal ontogenetic changes, and comparisons between day and night to understand patterns of diel vertical migration.

## Conclusion
In summary, ontogenetic vertical migration distributions are not uniform for reef-associated fish families of NSW, but the general pattern for these seven families was a downwards migration. When ichthyoplankton do exhibit patterns that could be associated with ontogenetic vertical migration, variables of length and stage-abundance can show contrasting patterns. Nevertheless, much can be put down to the difficulty in sampling individual larvae across all ontogenetic stage groups. Even when vertical patterns are seen, it needs to be remembered that a complex number of variables can also effect this distributional pattern, e.g. light, temperature, and food. Larval fish entrainment in eddies does not change ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns, but there is an effect on the abundance of larval stages and length of larvae at depths within an eddy compared to coastal waters. The ontogenetic vertical patterns described by this study will be useful for parameterising biophysical dispersal models, with the aim of understanding connectivity patterns of NSW reef fish larvae from each of these seven families.
