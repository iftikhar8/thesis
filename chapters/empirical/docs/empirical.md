# Title: Emprirical analysis of the vertical position of temperate reef ichthyoplankton - is it length or ontogeny?

## Introduction

### Why are we doing it? Was is it? Background

### Give the context of discovering early-life history behaviour, what has been done before?


### Aims / Hypothesis
Clearly state the hypothesis / problem being addressed (topic being addressed)

We investigated.....

Add in the rationale

Why did you choose the experimental design? - utilised other design based on competitive ship time.



## Methods

Sixteen stations were sampled along the eastern coast of Australia on
Australian Marine National Facility RV *Investigator* (http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Facilities/Marine-National-Facility) RV *Investigator* (2-18 June 2015). We sampled two stations within two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC).

Each station had two replicate tows

- sampled at night
- MOCNESS (how big was the mesh) and Neuston net (500um)
- MOCNESS was 4 nets (2x 5-50, 2x 50-100).
- Neuston was 2x 0-5m

All sampling was conducted only at night. 

Volume filtered, C-T-D data & flouresence were added.

Fish were split 50/50 preserved in 90% ethanol or a 10% buffered formalin solution.

### Study location
- Include figure of east coast of Australia with all the collection locations

### Experimental design & data collection

- Locations
- Replicates
- What we measured (length and ontogeny)
- Photograph, software etc.


### Data analysis
- Details on statistics software and R packages
- Data transformations
- Statistical tests

## Results
- Objectively display, without interpretation
- Logical order
- Start with text and refer to figures and tables

## Discussion

- Interpretation (in light of what is already known)
- How do we move forward from the introduction
- What new understandings have we got?
- What would be the next steps

- Use the same structure as the results
-
#### Ontogeny


#### Length


### Limitations

### Future directions

### Conclusion
