# Title: Is length or ontogeny a predictor of the vertical position of temperate reef ichthyoplankton in NSW?

## Introduction

### Why are we doing it? Was is it? Background

### Give the context of discovering early-life history behaviour, what has been done before?


### Aims / Hypothesis
Clearly state the hypothesis / problem being addressed (topic being addressed)

We investigated.....

Add in the rationale

Why did you choose the experimental design? - utilised other design based on competitive ship time.



## Methods

Sixteen stations were sampled along the eastern coast of Australia on
Australian Marine National Facility RV *Investigator* (http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Facilities/Marine-National-Facility) RV *Investigator* (2-18 June 2015, voyage number IN2013_v3). We sampled two stations within two coastal regions and two frontal eddies in the Eastern Australian Current (EAC).

* Create graphic of study area with locations

At each station we sampled using two nets, a MOCHNESS and Neuston net, both with 500 um meshes. The MOCHNESS net was setup to sample at two different depths 5-50 m and 50-100 m. The Neuston net captured plankton at the surface level of the station. Neuston and MOCHNESS nets were deployed at the same time and each net tow was replicated once. CTD measurements and flourscence was measured at each site.




Each station had two replicate tows

- sampled at night
- MOCNESS (how big was the mesh) and Neuston net (500um)
- MOCNESS was 4 nets (2x 5-50, 2x 50-100).
- Neuston was 2x 0-5m

All sampling was conducted only at night.

Volume filtered, C-T-D data & flouresence were added.

Fish were split 50/50 preserved in 90% ethanol or a 10% buffered formalin solution.

### Study location
- Include figure of east coast of Australia with all the collection locations

### Experimental design & data collection

- Locations
- Replicates
- What we measured (length and ontogeny)
- Photograph, software etc.

Each sample was initially sorted to seperate the ichthyoplankton from the general plankton samples. The larval fish were then sorted and identified to family taxonomic level where possible, referring to reference guides where appropriate (Books CalCOFI, Leis & Calvert, Miskiwiez et al.).

Fish were photographed using a calbirated stereo microscope and measured using the software ([Name of software]).

* Identified to ontogeny - show photographs.

### Data analysis

- Details on statistics software and R packages (require(MASS)
require(lmerTest)
require(lme4)
require(lsmeans))
- Data transformations
- Statistical tests

#### Ontogeny
The ontogeny count data was standardised by the flow to a concentration (250m^3).
Due to the excessive zero count for the ontogeny data, we separated it the analysis in to a generalised linear model (GLM) on the presence/absence data using a binomial distribution and a GLM on the data excluding all zero observations using a log normal distribution. The GLM model included four continuous variables to describe each location (temperature, salinity, oxygen and flurosence).

#### Length
The length data was

### General Fish results
The most common reef fish families caught were Pomcentridae,

### Length results




- Objectively display, without interpretation
- Logical order
- Start with text and refer to figures and tables

## Discussion

- Interpretation (in light of what is already known)
- How do we move forward from the introduction
- What new understandings have we got?
- What would be the next steps

- Use the same structure as the results
