# Chapter aims
- To investigate the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish families off the eastern coast of Australia
  - *Question 1*: Is ontogeny the major driver of change in depth?
  - *Question 2*: Is there an overall trend downwards for ichthyoplankton during ontogeny or is it taxa specific?
  - *Question 3*: If there are changes, at which stage does it occur pre-flexion / flexion / post-flexion
  - *Question 4*: Is length a better predictor than ontogenetic stage?

# The reef fish
- Reef associated fish were identified down to eight families:
  - Scarid (9 species)
  - Labrid (81 species)
  - Synodontid (7 species)
  - Scorpid (13 species)
  - Mullid (11 species)
  - Pomacentrid (64 species)
  - Serranid (30 species)

(species lists from FishBase.org)

# Study sites
- Collected along the eastern coast of Australia in June 2015 (Brisbane to Sydney).
- 16 stations
  - Separated by latitude
    - North 27.3-29.1 and South 31.6-32.3 (SST differed by 1-2 degrees )
  - Separated by water features (coastal waters and eddies)
  - Data collected on SST, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, salinity
---
# Collection
- Three depths used with 500 micron mesh
  - Neuston nets used to collect the surface
    - Unbalanced design: No nets at site 16 because of rough weather and no flow meter at site 8
  - EZ nets getting two depths (5-50m, 50-100m)
---
# Data
- Standardised to count data / m3
- Removed and extra tows
- Two sites are unbalanced?
- Used a 2x2 contingency table (does it require count data > 0) and chi-square tests
- Need to investigate log-linear models??

# Results
---
# Labrid
![lab_mosaic](../figs/outline/mosaic_lab.png "Labrid ovm")
---
# Labrid
- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres
- Preflexion peaks in 5-50
- Flexion similar across levels
- Post-flexion peaks 50-100 and 0m.
---
# Mullidae
![mul_mosaic](../figs/outline/mosaic_mul.png "Mullid ovm")
---
# Mullidae
- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion / flexion / post-flexion similar 0-50
- Flexion dominates mullids found below 50m
---
# Synodontidae
![mosaic_syd](../figs/outline/mosaic_syd.png "Synodontid ovm")
---
# Synodontidae
- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly at 0m
- Flexion dominates lizardfish found below 50m
- Post-flexion always least common
---
# Serranids
![mosaic_ser](../figs/outline/mosaic_ser.png "Serranid ovm")
---
# Serranids
- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly caught 0-50
- Flexion and preflexion caught equally 50-100
- Post-flexion hardly caught 0-100, increases with depth
---
# Scorpenids
![mosaic_sco](../figs/outline/mosaic_sco.png "Scorpenids ovm")
---
# Scorpenids
- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly caught 0
- Flexion equal % 0-100
- Post-flexion increases with depth, dominates > 50m
---
# Scarids
![mosaic_sca](../figs/outline/mosaic_sca.png "Scarids ovm")
---
# Scarids
- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres, equal amount surface and deep
- Not many preflexion.
- Pre-flexion, flexion decrease with depth, post-flexion increases
---
# Pomacentrids
![mosaic_pom](../figs/outline/mosaic_pom.png "Pomacentrids ovm")
---
# Pomacentrids
- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres, not many below 50m
- Not many post-flexion (increased swimming ability?)
- Pre-flexion decreases with depth, flexion and post-flexion increases
