# The empirical chapter outline

## Chapter aims
- To investigate the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish families off the eastern coast of Australia
  - *Question 1*: Is ontogeny a major driver of change in depth?
  - *Question 2*: Is length a major driver of change in depth?
  - *Question 3*: Is there an overall depth trend for temperate ichthyoplankton or is it taxa specific?
  - *Question 4*: If there are changes, at which stage does it occur e.g. pre-flexion / flexion / post-flexion or at a specific length?


# Methods

# Fish collected
* Reef associated fish were identified down to eight families (species found in the area as per FishBase.org):
  - Scarid (9 species)
  - Labrid (81 species)
  - Synodontid (7 species)
  - Scorpid (13 species)
  - Mullid (11 species)
  - Pomacentrid (64 species)
  - Serranid (30 species)


# Study sites
- Collected along the eastern coast of Australia in June 2015 (Brisbane to Sydney).
- 16 stations
  - Separated by latitude
    - North 27.3-29.1 and South 31.6-32.3 (SST differed by 1-2 degrees )
  - Separated by water features (coastal waters and eddies)
  - Data collected on SST, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, salinity

# Collection
- Three depths used with 500 micron mesh
  - Neuston nets used to collect the surface
    - Unbalanced design: No nets at site 16 because of rough weather and no flow meter at site 8
  - EZ nets getting two depths (5-50m, 50-100m)

# Data
- Standardised to count data / m3
- Removed and extra tows
- Two sites are unbalanced due to flower meter not working on one and rough seas preventing another
- Used a contingency table and chi-square tests at this stage
- Still trying to workout how I can tease out better analysis

# Results

Scorpaenidae  | 176
Serranidae    | 593
Synodontidae  | 140

Stage | Count
------|------
Pre-flexion   | 1089
Flexion   | 856
Post-flexion   | 882

# Ontogeny summary
Unbalanced counts in each group (especially serranidae - bias of nets or swimming ability?)

![](../figs/families_stage_count.png "Ontogeny by families")

# Sites
Not all stages (or families) caught at all sites, Labrids most consistent
![](../figs/site_stage.png "Ontogeny by site")

# Location (Northern or mid-NSW)
Location doesn't appear to be a factor

![](../figs/location_stage.png "Ontogeny by location")

# Feature (Coastal water or Eddies)
Labrids and scarids (older) found 2x more in eddies

# Ontogeny and depth
![](../figs/depth_stage.png "Ontogeny by depth")


- Labridae - majority caught in the 5-50m bin.
- Mullidae - hardly any PRE caught below 50m (drops off in both Pos & Fle too)
- Poms - No pos caught at surface. Also not many below 50m
- Scaridae - similar patterns at each depth.
- Scorpion fish - Opposite trends in surface and > 50m. Similar at 25m
- Serranids - huge number of pre-flexion, drops off at 50m. Flexion, post-flexion most caught below 50m
- Synodontids - Pre-flexion at surface. All mostly occur 5-50m.

<!-- # Contingency table analysis

# Labrid
![](../figs/outline/mosaic_lab.png "Labrid ovm")

- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres
- Preflexion peaks in 5-50
- Flexion similar across levels
- Post-flexion peaks 50-100 and 0m.

# Mullidae
![](../figs/outline/mosaic_mul.png "Mullid ovm")

- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion / flexion / post-flexion similar 0-50
- Flexion dominates mullids found below 50m

# Synodontidae
![](../figs/outline/mosaic_syd.png "Synodontid ovm")

- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly at 0m
- Flexion dominates lizardfish found below 50m
- Post-flexion always least common

# Serranids
![](../figs/outline/mosaic_ser.png "Serranid ovm")

- Most fish caught in 0-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly caught 0-50
- Flexion and preflexion caught equally 50-100
- Post-flexion hardly caught 0-100, increases with depth

# Scorpenids
![](../figs/outline/mosaic_sco.png "Scorpenids ovm")

- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres
- Preflexion mainly caught 0
- Flexion equal % 0-100
- Post-flexion increases with depth, dominates > 50m

# Scarids

![](../figs/outline/mosaic_sca.png "Scarids ovm")

- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres, equal amount surface and deep
- Not many preflexion.
- Pre-flexion, flexion decrease with depth, post-flexion increases

# Pomacentrids

![](../figs/outline/mosaic_pom.png "Pomacentrids ovm")

- Most fish caught in 5-50 metres, not many below 50m
- Not many post-flexion (increased swimming ability?)
- Pre-flexion decreases with depth, flexion and post-flexion increases -->

# Length by depth

![depth_length](../figs/depth_length.png "Length by depth")

Seems to a trend of deeper for larger fish
