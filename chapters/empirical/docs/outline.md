# The empirical chapter outline

# Chapter aims
- To investigate the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish families off the eastern coast of Australia
  - *Question 1*: Is ontogeny the major driver of change in depth?
  - *Question 2*: Is there an overall trend downwards for ichthyoplankton during ontogeny or is it taxa specific?
  - *Question 3*: If there are changes, at which stage does it occur pre-flexion / flexion / post-flexion
  - *Question 4*: Is length a better predictor than ontogenetic stage?

# The reef fish
- Reef associated fish were identified down to eight families:
  - Scarid (9 species)
  - Labrid (81 species)
  - Synodontid (7 species)
  - Scorpid (13 species)
  - Mullid (11 species)
  - Pomacentrid (64 species)
  - Serranid (30 species)

(species lists from FishBase.org)

# Study sites
- Collected along the eastern coast of Australia in June 2015 (Brisbane to Sydney).
- 16 stations
  - Separated by latitude
    - North 27.3-29.1 and South 31.6-32.3 (SST differed by 1-2 degrees )
  - Separated by water features (coastal waters and eddies)
  - Data collected on SST, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, salinity
---
# Collection
- Three depths used with 500 micron mesh
  - Neuston nets used to collect the surface
    - Unbalanced design: No nets at site 16 because of rough weather and no flow meter at site 8
  - EZ nets getting two depths (5-50m, 50-100m)
---
# Data
- Standardised to count data / m3
- Removed and extra tows
- Two sites are unbalanced?
- Used a 2x2 contingency table (does it require count data > 0) and chi-square tests
- Need to investigate log-linear models??

# Ontogeny summary
Unbalanced counts in each group (especially serranidae - bias of nets or swimming ability?)
![families by ontogeny](../figs/families_stage_count.png "Ontogeny by families")
---
# Sites
Not all stages (or families) caught at all sites, Labrids most consistent
![sites by ontogeny](../figs/site_stage.png "Ontogeny by site")
---
# Location (Northern or mid-NSW)
Location doesn't appear to be a factor
![location by ontogeny](../figs/location_stage.png "Ontogeny by location")
---
# Feature (Coastal water or Eddies)
Labrids and scarids (older) found 2x more in eddies

# Ontogeny and depth 1
![depth by ontogeny](../figs/depth_stage.png "Ontogeny by depth")
---
# Ontogeny and depth 2
- Labridae - majority caught in the 5-50m bin.
- Mullidae - hardly any PRE caught below 50m (drops off in both Pos & Fle too)
- Poms - No pos caught at surface. Also not many below 50m
- Scaridae - similar patterns at each depth.
- Scorpion fish - Opposite trends in surface and > 50m. Similar at 25m
- Serranids - huge number of pre-flexion, drops off at 50m. Flexion, post-flexion most caught below 50m
- Synodontids - Pre-flexion at surface. All mostly occur 5-50m.
