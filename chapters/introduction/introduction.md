A collection of processes contributes to the connectivity between reefs: spawning production, dispersal by ocean currents, larvae behaviours (e.g. swimming), survival, settlement behaviour and post-settlement survival (Cowen & Sponaugle 2009). Therefore to understand connectivity both physical and biological processes must be considered. Connectivity is one of the more challenging problems to study empirically in marine ecology. Fish larvae are very small (1 - 8 mm), they can disperse over long distances and they suffer from high mortality. It is not practical (or possible) for a scientist to follow larvae from spawning to settlement. There are several current empirical techniques for measuring connectivity, which all suffer from labour-intensive methodologies and become less scalable as the dispersal distance increases. For larvae dispersing over hundreds of kilometres, knowing exactly where they settle is analogous to searching for a needle in a haystack. Several empirical techniques will be discussed further in the next section.

### Natural markers

The advantage of natural markers is that they are ubiquitous amongst larval fish. The most common natural marker used to measure dispersal is through genetics. While there are several different genetic methodologies for measuring dispersal, the two most frequently used are looking at historical trends through gene flow, and dispersal in one generation using parentage analysis. Gene flow involves comparing genetic markers between populations to see if discrete populations have been connected by exchange of breeding individuals, and its the most common technique to show linkages between populations [@doherty1995; @curley2009]. (Downsides)

Parentage analysis is a more arduous technique, requiring sampling of both parents and progeny to determine the dispersal, but has been used to indicate levels of self-recruitment in populations [@jones2005; @herrera2016]. (Downsides)

Recent advances in genetics means this is a constantly changing field, and provides great potential for better empirical measurements. Newer cutting edge techniques such as genetic assignment tests on allele frequencies can also give insight into the dispersal movement between populations [@simpson2014].

The natural elemental composition of an otolith can have markers of the waters the fish was born, and thus can give insight into the dispersal of larval fish [@campana1999]. For this technique to be effective, the spatial regions of interest must have identifiably different chemical signatures, otherwise the true birth location can be hard to ascertain [@thorrold2002]. An inherent difficulty is that in marine and freshwater systems, the environmental markers are in constant flux, therefore constant monitoring is required to confidently predict dispersal [@gillanders2002]. This technique has been used successfully to linking adults to their juvenile nurseries in estuaries [@gillanders2003].

### Physical tagging

One technique developed in the last 15 years is to mark the otoliths of ichthyoplankton using trans-generational techniques [@thorrold2006]. Adult females injected with enriched stable-isotopes (e.g. ^137^Ba), pass on the isotope into each egg, which goes onto to be incorporated into the otolith of the progeny, allowing for tracking of dispersal distance. The benefits of this technique is the reduction in effort, by only having to inject the female, which in turn marks all the eggs she produces. Also by using different concentrations of the stable-isotope, information about the specific natal location can be encapsulated. Studies have used this technique effectively to investigate connectivity of reef fish populations over small spatial scales [@almany2007], and even comparing interannual variability through exhaustive sampling [@cuif2015]. Another more labour intensive technique involves tagging clutches of eggs with fluorescent chemical markers [@thorrold2002; @jones2005]. The otoliths of the captured post-settlement juvenile fish can be removed and examined under a microscope for fluorescent staining. This method of staining is a blunter instrument, as the marker cannot be changed per location, and only marks the one event.

The difficulty of these empirical.....

also in many of these empirical methods, there is a lot of uncertainty, most notably in small sample sizes, although statistical tools have been developed to try and overcome these issues [@kaplan2007]

(BIOPHYSICAL MODELLING)

Computer modelling techniques allow us to predict connectivity at finer temporal and spatial resolutions than is possible with the empirical methods described above. Our knowledge of oceanographic currents has been considerably advanced through technology such as satellites and ocean drifters. Dispersal by ocean currents has the greatest effect on larval movement thus forming the basis for modelling connectivity. The first connectivity models were based on passive advection of the particles by ocean currents (Bartsch 1988). Advances in knowledge of oceanography and larval behaviour, coupled with advances in technology have seen biophysical models become ever more complex, using multiple hydrodynamic models and larval behaviours.

Thesis outline
--------------

The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the different biological traits of reef fish that influence their dispersal and therefore the connectivity between populations. This question was answered with four specific, but interrelated data chapters. Firstly, I wanted to identify the traits that were being identified as important to include, bother physical and biological, as seen in the published biophysical dispersal modelling studies. Secondly, I wanted to gather empirical data for one of these important biological traits where the was a data gap for fish in the region. Thirdly, using regional hydrodynamics, I wanted to see the effects on reef fish connectivity patterns of different behaviours, different parametrisation of a specific behaviour, and different methods of applying a specific behaviour. Finally, synthesising all this information, I wanted to investigate the connectivity patterns of an endemic and threatened reef fish, and determine the management implications of these potential patterns.

Three decades of research using biophysical dispersal models (BDMs) have provided numerous of examples of major findings and advances in connectivity research [@miller2007; @willis2011; @cowen2009]. As with any cohesive field of research, there is a collective aim to advance our overall understanding of the discipline. For instance, what are typical levels of connectivity that one can expect for different types of system and life histories? Are there generalities to the importance of factors like larval behaviour (swimming ability, sensory ability, cues that initiate settlement) or even aspects of the oceanographic forcing models (time steps, resolution, integration method) that profoundly affect connectivity outcomes. Does a longer pelagic larval duration (PLD) increase the size of the dispersal kernel or can a species limit how far they disperse through vertical migration? The establishment, where possibly, of generalities to these and other issues allows the field to progress. It provides guidance for new studies, allowing them to build on previous ones. This process is critical to the use of biophysical connectivity model outputs in management where there is an expectation that they will be accurate and useful across a broad range of scenarios. The first data chapter is a meta-analysis, evaluating published BDMs, identifying modelling decisions (both physical and biological), with the aim of building upon a previous review by @miller2007. The initial aim of the chapter is to identify trends in the inclusion, and exclusion, of modelling parameters. The goal was to understand if these is a minimum suite of parameters, or default values for parameters that should be included in future BDM studies. More importantly, the final aim of the chapter was to understand the consequences of modelling choices on the resulting connectivity patterns. Common metrics were identified and compared across different parameter choices to understand the effects. These results provide a template for BMDs in the future by highlighting the ramifications of modelling choice, and identifying knowledge gaps in influential parameters choices.

The impetus for the Chapter 3, was the lack of empirical data on the early life history of ichthyoplankton. One of the biggest issues to overcome within the field of connectivity is the dearth of knowledge on many of these influential biological traits,. Another issue is that with the information we do know, it is difficult to generalise due to the differences between species, within species and across geographic locations [cite LEIS]. The meta-analysis in Chapter 2 found that vertical migration was a key consideration for connectivity modelling of ichthyoplankton. Therefore, I decided to gather data on the ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of reef fish off the coast of NSW, categorising larval fish into three ontogenetic stages using the development of the caudal fin; preflexion, flexion, and postflexion. While there have been many larval fish assemblage studies off the NSW coast [cite], no study had specifically looked at ontogenetic vertical distribution patterns. The study also considered the effect of oceanographic features on this pattern, to see if the ontogenetic distribution changed when larval fish were in coastal waters entrained by the East Australia Current, or entrained inside a mesoscale eddy.

Chapter 4 was a theoretical modelling study, testing the effect of different behaviours: passive, vertical advection (VA), diel vertical migration (DVM), ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS), on the connectivity patterns from a BDM of the New South Wales region. [Talk about effect on modelling] Understanding important behaviours to model in the region allow us know which behaviours to implement, and where to focus empirical research. The second aim of this chapter was to gain an understanding of the sensitivity of an behaviour to different values, and different methods. Insight into how connectivity patterns are affected by parameter choice helps us understand the impacts our assumptions when empirical knowledge of a behaviour for a particular species is not available in from the literature.

The final chapter synthesised the results of each of the previous data chapters to generate potential

It will also identify gaps in our implementation of these parameters which should serve to identify necessary empirical work needed to address t

In Chapter 2, I therefore reviewed the current literature using DNA-based methods for the assessment of predator diets and applications of this method for exploring trophic interactions. This review provides a valuable semi-quantitative synthesis of the uses, strengths and future research needs of DNA-based diet analysis across a broad range of predators and ecosystems. The review highlights DNA-based methods as the most taxonomically sensitive method available and effective for obtaining detailed information on ecological interactions in a complex food web, and I therefore apply DNA-based techniques to my study system.

The aim of Chapter 2 and 3 of this thesis was to determine whether the existing native Sydney rock oyster S. glomerata was under stress from the development of artificial habitats in an urbanised estuary and the presence of the invasive Pacific oyster (C. gigas). It was predicted that current human disturbances in the form of coastal development will affect the abundance, size, distribution and health of estuarine oysters, and increase the abundance of invasive oysters.

The first aim was to investgate

The influence of modelling choices, both physical and biological parameters, were measured using common metrics of connectivity.

In this study, we review the recent literature using BDMs to evaluate the ability of this collective body of work to provide insight into the ramifications of the choices we make when attempting to include complexity and realism in our models. We achieve this aim by firstly evaluating if the field is progressing in its inclusion of biological parameters. We look at the collection of parameters included in BDMs, how this is changing over time, and if there are trends in how parameters are included (or excluded) based on the context of models. We define a model as a distinct collection of parameters for a BDM, and a study as a published collection of one or more models. Secondly, and most importantly, we look at the consequences of including different parameters on model results. Here we assess if there are observable differences in key metrics of connectivity as a result of the inclusion of specific biological parameters. We also assess the degree to which the physical context of the models regulate any observed effect of biological parameters. This information will serve to guide the application of BDMs into the future and by highlighting the ramifications of the inclusion/exclusion of key biological parameters. It will also identify gaps in our implementation of these parameters which should serve to identify necessary empirical work needed to address these shortcomings.

ing potential connectivity patterns, as empirical studies using current methods are inherently difficult over extended spatial and temporal scales. For BDMs to become mature research tools, we need to know understand what are the important parameters in predicting connectivity patterns - what traits should modellers focus on. Producing accurate models, leading to better understanding of the connectivity between marine populations has important conservation implications in the design of marine protected areas. This project models these connectivity patterns using a biophysical model and specifically focuses on the traits of pelagic larvae of reef fish that influence connectivity and how these patterns can be used as a conservation tool. The project has four logical sections that each flow on from each other, firstly a meta-analysis to see what parameters BDMs were implementing and how they were affecting the estimated connectivity, secondly an empirical chapter to gather data with which to parametrise an important biological trait, thirdly a theoretical modelling chapter to see how different biological trait

The overarching aim of this thesis was to develop and implement an investigative framework aimed at identifying trophic effects resulting from the recovery of two important coastal predators, Australian and long-nosed fur seals, on complex, temperate ecosystems in southeastern Australia (Error! Reference source not found.). What do these predators eat in a relatively novel environment? Does the return of fur seals to coastal ecosystems of southeastern Australia hail direct (consumptive) and indirect (non-consumptive) effects cascading from prey species down to the lowest trophic levels in complex marine ecosystems? I therefore embarked on a project to determine whether the recolonisation of important coastal predators, fur seals, mattered or not to the reef ecosystems of southeastern Australian. Overall, I hypothesised that the recovery of fur seals in eastern Australia would result in: (1) important consumptive interactions linking fur seals to temperate reefs, which would (2) lead to prey limitation, and subsequently (3) release secondary consumers from pressure by mesopredators, thereby (4) increasing herbivory on temperate reefs (Error! Reference source not found.).

The overarching objective of this thesis was to translate insights size spectra have offered into the structure and function of other marine ecosystems to temperate and tropical reefs. Specifically, I sought to explore the insights that size spectra analyses could give into how size- based processes shape reef fish communities, and into ecosystem baselines.
