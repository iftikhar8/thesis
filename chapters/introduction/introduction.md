General Introduction
====================

What is connectivity?
---------------------

-	General meaning
-	bipartite Life styles etc.

Broad statement on thesis. What is this thesis trying to achieve?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Why is connectivity important?
------------------------------

-	Understanding population dynamics
-	Many species with bipartite life cycles.
-	Conservation, e.g. MPAs

How do we measure connectivity ?
--------------------------------

-	Population genetics
-	Parentage analysis
-	Otolith tagging
-	Isotope tagging
-	All these are difficult... so: Biophyscial dispersal modelling
-	General backgorund and what does it mean

Important of Models
-------------------

-	what can they tell us, e.g. applications of the modelling

What are the issues we face with modelling ?
--------------------------------------------

-	empirical data issues
-	complexity of modelling choices

Introduction to chapters
------------------------

CHAPTER 2: Meta-analysis: what was I trying to achieve
------------------------------------------------------

-	Find out what parameters were important ? How did parameter choice effect modelling choice ? -

CHAPTER 3: empirical
--------------------

-	getting local data for fish species

CHAPTER 4: theoretical
----------------------

-	what are some important features?

CHAPTER 5: black cod
--------------------

-	using connectivity ,can we see if the networks are effective?
