General Introduction
====================

Marine populations are structurally different to terrestrial populations as the conditions of the fluid environment typically favour open populations [@caley1996; @figueira2006]. The ocean is a dynamic system, with currents dispersing eggs or larvae, over potentially considerable distances, creating interconnected regions. Larval dispersal has been a topic of interest in marine ecology for over a century [@hjort1914; @hjort1926]. Traditionally the focus has been on larval supply and recruitment dynamics [@underwood1984; @gaines1985; @victor1983; @doherty1991], however recent advancements in the field have allowed us to investigate where recruited larvae come from, which has revealed these systems are not as open as previously thought [@jones2005; @swearer1999a; @cowen2000]. The spatial extent of this dispersal and the connectivity between areas are key questions within the field of marine ecology. Connectivity, for the purposes of this thesis, is defined as the exchange of individuals between spatially discrete populations [@cowen2009], in turn, these connected populations are defined as a metapopulation [@hanski1998]. Metapopulations, within the marine context, are primarily connected populations through the processes of dispersal and recruitment of larvae [@sale2006a]. Connectivity within a metapopulation can be highly volatile due to events that are intrinsic (e.g. low exchange of individuals) or extrinsic (e.g. natural variation in currents). The connectivity between populations is fundamental to; community dynamics (local and metapopulation levels), genetic diversity, and population persistence [@burgess2014; @lowe2010; @lett2015]. However, the influence of biological processes that contribute to this connectivity, the influence of variation in connectivity patterns on population dynamics, and the connectivity patterns exhibited by many marine species, are not fully understood [@cowen2007; @giangrande2017; @snyder2015]

The central theme of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the processes that influence the dispersal and connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton. The thesis is divided into four sections: a meta-analysis comparing studies to assess the trends and influence of biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) parameters; collecting empirical data of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) patterns of ichthyoplankton, a process known to influence connectivity; using a BDM to investigate the influences of different behaviours, strategies and modelling choices on connectivity patterns; and finally synthesising the results to predict the connectivity patterns of a temperate reef fish using a BDM, and comparing these patterns with the current network of marine protected areas (MPAs).


What is connectivity?
---------------------

Many marine species, reef fish included, experience a two-stage lifecycle: pelagic larval and sessile adult stages. The differences in morphology, habitat, and behaviour between these two stages of larval fish development can be striking [@leis2000]. The sedentary nature of the adult stage for species with this dual lifecycle, results in connectivity between discrete populations (and within metapopulations) occurring predominantly during this pelagic larval phase, unlike terrestrial animals where this connectivity occurs primarily by adult migration. Pelagic larvae can disperse over extensive distances, hundreds or even thousands of kilometres, therefore measurement can be difficult [@levin2006]. The closest terrestrial example is seed dispersal, but unlike seeds, fish larvae have inherent behaviours that can influence their dispersal [@cowen2009].

Most reef fish are oviparous, females either lay their eggs attached to a benthic substrate (e.g. rock or plant) or broadcast spawn them for males to fertilise. Fecundity can range from tens of thousands to millions of eggs, a strategy, which offsets the extremely high mortality rate for larval fish [i.e. greater than 99.95%; @houde1989; @mcgurk1986]. Upon hatching, larval fish are not fully developed and undergo morphological changes before becoming a settlement stage juvenile. The ontogenetic stages of larval fish are described around the development of the caudal fin, a process called flexion. Flexion is defined as the point in development at which the notochord of a larval fish starts bending upwards at approximately 45 degrees to begin the formation of the caudal fin. The development of the caudal fin allows larvae to start developing swimming abilities and transforming from planktonic to nektonic [@leis2006]. Hatching from the egg until the flexion event is defined as preflexion, and postflexion describes the period after the caudal fin has developed, but before the juvenile stage. The period the fish spends in this larval stage is called the pelagic larval duration (PLD). The PLD ends when the larvae settle, which requires them to be developed enough to swim and sense suitable settlement habitat. The length of this period is species-specific, but despite some variability, there is typically similarity within a taxonomic level [genus or family; @victor2000; @wilson1999]. Variation within PLDs arises due to individual larva having flexibility in the timing of settlement, though there are certain physiological limitations on the earliest and latest timing of settlement.

Connectivity patterns are the interface of a complex series of physical and biological processes. Connectivity starts with the spawning event, the timing and location of which is the primary biological influence affecting dispersal patterns [@puckett2014; @bauer2015; @donahue2015]. The largest contributing process to connectivity is the dispersal by ocean currents and hydrodynamics modelling of ocean systems is a mature field. Entrainment in oceanographic features, such as mesoscale eddies, can influence dispersal by changing the direction and increasing development of larvae [@graber1997; @shulzitski2015]. The length of the PLD influences the connectivity, however, there is no unifying theory [@koeck2015a; @treml2012; @mora2012]. It is now understood that fish larvae are not passively advected, and once released into the plankton ichthyoplankton start developing behaviours that can influence the pattern of dispersal. Vertical migration (diel and ontogenetic) is one such behaviour that allows larval fish to reduce their dispersal distance by moving away from wind-driven surface currents [@paris2004]. Reaching the developmental stage of flexion allow larvae to start swimming, often at speeds greater than the encompassing current advecting them [@fisher2000]. Larval fish develop a suite of senses that allows them to detect and swim in the direction of settlement habitat [@gerlach2007a; @bottesch2016]. It is thought larvae must be close to some available settlement habitat before the end of their pelagic larval duration or they die [@cowen2009].

Why is connectivity important?
------------------------------

Besides births and deaths, connectivity is the key process that defines the dynamics of both local and metapopulations [@figueira2006]. Local populations [discrete subpopulations within a metapopulation, ignoring the movement of adults; @grimm2003] that are demographically connected rely on stable connectivity from source populations to persist [@lowe2010]. This thesis focuses on ecologically relevant connectivity, i.e. demographic connectivity whereby dispersal effects population growth and persistence [@gotelli1991], and not genetic connectivity, which requires only a few individuals to be exchanged [@slatkin1993].

Understanding connectivity of marine systems is paramount for the conservation and management of metapopulations [@roberts1997]. An important instrument in the marine conservation toolbox is marine protected areas (MPAs) [@halpern2003; @lubchenco2003; @mellin2016]. Historically, habitat quality and habitat preservation have been the main priorities for marine conservation and connectivity has often been overlooked [@crowder2006]. Preserving habitat is an important facet of conservation but does not provide the same ability for populations to recover from disturbance as well connected networks of protected areas [@almany2009]. Therefore, to address population persistence, connectivity is now considered a key requirement when designing MPAs [@botsford2009; @christie2010; @abesamis2016; @jonsson2015; @smith2018]. However, designing a unified network is not without its difficulty [@kendall2015; @watson2012] or controversy [@roff2014] as marine species have different dispersal distances and the natural variation of extrinsic factors. Dynamic marine protected systems are a recent conservation management paradigm [@smith2007] proposed to address the flux seen in connectivity patterns [@soria2014].

How do we measure connectivity?
--------------------------------

Connectivity is one of the more challenging problems to study empirically in marine ecology. Directly measuring ichthyoplankton connectivity with current techniques is often impractical (and often impossible). Larvae are minuscule (measured in mm) and exist within a vast oceanic environment. Larval fish are inherently difficult to track due to the combination of a PLD ranging from weeks to months that allows them to disperse long distances [@victor2000] and a high mortality rate meaning only a fraction of larvae spawned will settle [@houde1989]. Despite these difficulties, there are several direct and indirect methods for measuring dispersal, using natural and physical tags.

Natural markers are ubiquitous amongst larval fish [@campana2001; @kennedy1997], which makes them experimentally advantageous. Genetic material is the most common natural marker used to measure connectivity [@hedgecock2007]. There are several different methodologies for measuring dispersal using genetics, e.g. using genetic markers to compare gene flow between populations [@crandall2012; @serrano2016; @hepburn2009] or using parentage analysis to determine where progeny recruit [@jones2005; @berumen2012a; @planes2009]. Population-level gene flow is an indirect measure that requires less sampling effort, leading to a wider use amongst studies. Quantifying connectivity through gene flow involves comparing genetic micro-satellite markers to determine if spatially discrete populations share genetic material [@doherty1995; @curley2009; @foster2012]. The caveat to describing connectivity using gene flow is that only information on historical dispersal events can be determined. Therefore, it is uncertain if larval connectivity occurred directly between two populations or indirectly through one or more connected populations. Parentage analysis, on the other hand, gives direct evidence of dispersal events but it requires onerous sampling of parents and progeny. This technique uses genetic markers to identify the natal population of new recruits giving estimates of dispersal distance [@williamson2016; @berumen2012a; @planes2009], and with sufficient sampling can indicate the level of self-recruitment in populations [@jones2005; @herrera2016]. The level of sampling difficulty increases when considering wider spatial or longer temporal extents. However, new methodologies have shown that dispersal kernels can be estimated by only sampling 3% of the population [@bode2018]. Determining connectivity through genetic markers is a constantly changing field, with recent advancements giving the potential for greater insight into the dispersal movement between populations, e.g. genetic assignment tests on allele frequencies [@simpson2014].

A non-genetic natural marker for measuring the dispersal of larval fish is the elemental composition of an otolith, which can have markers of the surrounding chemical compositions of the water where the fish was spawned [@campana1999; @thorrold2001; @swearer1999a]. This technique has been used successfully to link adults with their juvenile nurseries in estuaries [@gillanders2003; @kennedy1997]. For this technique to be effective, the spatial regions of interest must have identifiably different chemical signatures, otherwise, the true birth location can be hard to ascertain [@thorrold2002]. An inherent difficulty is that in marine and freshwater systems, the environmental markers are in constant flux [@swearer2003] and therefore constant monitoring must confidently predict dispersal using otoliths [@gillanders2002].

Techniques for physical markers on larval fish have developed in the last 15 years that allow direct measurement for connectivity [@cowen2009]. Physical tagging can be applied using fluorescent chemical markers [@jones1999; @thorrold2002; @jones2005], staining clutches of eggs that provides information about the connectivity from a single location. Trans-generational marking, a technique less intensive than fluorescent marking, involves injecting adult breeding females with enriched stable-isotopes (e.g. ^137^Ba) that are passed onto each spawned egg and are incorporated into the otolith of the larvae [@thorrold2006]. Dispersal can be measured by sampling new recruits and detecting the stable isotope in the otolith. Studies have used this technique effectively to investigate connectivity of reef fish populations over small spatial scales [@almany2007] and comparing inter-annual variability [albeit with exhaustive sampling; @cuif2015]. The advantage of trans-generational marking is first that marking one female, in turn, marks each egg produced (for a period), reducing the number of adults required to mark, and secondly that by using different concentrations of the stable-isotope, different locations can be discerned. The direct and indirect empirical methods described above, can give accurate measurements of dispersal success and distance over smaller spatial scales, but become almost impossible when considering long dispersal distances, e.g. coastal extents. In addition, low sample sizes lead to a lot of uncertainty in the results of these empirical methods, although statistical tools have been developed to address these issues [@kaplan2017].

An alternative method to empirical measurement is using a biophysical dispersal model (BDM) to predict potential connectivity patterns [@paris2007; @sponaugle2002; @treml2015]. Modelling provides the ability to manipulate parameters, and therefore ask questions that cannot be easily achieved with empirical methods, e.g. changing spatial extents ranging from localised reefs [@andutta2012] to global connectivity [@wood2013] and changing temporal scales from intra-annual [@robins2013] to inter-annual [@young2012]. Manipulating parameters allows for exploration into the influence of physical and biological processes and biological traits on connectivity, something that is difficult to measure empirically. These modelled patterns of connectivity combined with other empirical measures of dispersal is a powerful tool for the inference of larval connectivity [@werner2007; @coscia2012; @foster2012].

Biophysical dispersal models (BDMs) are a mature research methodology, used in studies of larval dispersal for three decades [@bartsch1988] with increasing complexity [@miller2007]. Consisting of coupled physical and biological models, BDMs reflect the complex interaction of processes on connectivity patterns. The physical model is a numerical hydrodynamic model, often combined with data assimilation techniques of observation systems to resolve mesoscale and sub-mesoscale oceanographic processes, e.g., fronts and eddies. Open ocean circulation models are well understood, however, the near-shore dynamics (interaction of cross-shore and along-shore processes) are not as established [@largier2003].

Compared to our understanding of oceanographic processes, the fundamentals of many biological processes are not well understood. As our understanding of the early-life history of ichthyoplankton (and other marine species) has progressed, the biological models in BDMs have increased in complexity. Individual-based models are the most common type of BMDs, whereby the model advects individual particles encapsulating larval traits and behaviours through the hydrodynamic matrix. The biological models are often species-specific, using information gained from empirical studies of the early-life history for that particular species, but sometimes uses general information to describe a suite of species. Studies using species-specific models are often difficult due to the lack of available information on the early-life history of many species and often many assumptions must be made [@leis2007b]. Therefore, identifying key biological processes influencing connectivity and information on larval fish behaviour are important areas of research. The results of models are predictive only, and qualification on applications of these models is justified. Research must also focus on the validation of these models, considering the input parameters, the modelled processes, and the predicted connectivity patterns.

Thesis outline
--------------

The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the processes that influence the dispersal and  connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton. This topic was explored through four specific, but interrelated data chapters. Firstly, I conducted a meta-analysis of published BDM studies in an attempt to identify the influence of specific modelling decisions and choices on resulting connectivity patterns and metrics. Secondly, I gathered empirical data for ontogenetic vertical migration, a biological trait considered influential of connectivity patterns, for which there was a data gap in the region. Thirdly, using a BDM, I investigated the influence of the inclusion of different larval behaviours as well as how some of them were parameterised and implemented on connectivity patterns. Finally, synthesising these results, I explored the predicted connectivity patterns of an endemic and threatened Australian reef fish, Black Cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) and determined any conservation management implications.

Three decades of research using BDMs have given many of examples of major findings and advances in connectivity research [@miller2007; @willis2011; @cowen2009]. As with any cohesive field of research, there is a collective aim to advance our overall understanding of the discipline. To move forward, generalities are sought, yet many studies produce conflicting results [@leis2010]. The first data chapter is a meta-analysis, evaluating published BDMs, identifying modelling decisions (both physical and biological), with the aim of building upon a previous review by @miller2007. The first aim of the chapter was to identify trends in the inclusion and exclusion of modelling parameters, with the goal of understanding if there is a minimum suite of parameters that should be included in future BDM studies. More importantly, the final aim of the chapter was to understand the consequences of modelling choices on the resulting connectivity patterns. Common metrics were identified and compared across different parameter choices to understand the effects. These results provide a template for BDMs in the future by highlighting the outcomes of modelling choice and identifying knowledge gaps in influential parameters choices.

The impetus for Chapter 3 was the knowledge gaps in the empirical data on the OVM patterns of ichthyoplankton found along the eastern coast of Australia. Vertical migration, the ability of ichthyoplankton to change position in the water column, is known to influence connectivity patterns by acting as a retention mechanism and limiting the dispersal [@paris2004]. Knowledge gaps on OVM patterns can hinder connectivity research on specific species, as BDMs can be forced to exclude OVM behaviour if no information is available. Even with the information that is available on species, generalising within species, between species, and across regions is fraught with difficulties due to the variability [@leis2007b]. OVM is considered an important process in the connectivity of larval fish [@paris2007], and therefore I decided to gather data on these patterns for reef fish off the eastern coast of Australia. The experiment consisted of 16 sites, sampling larval fish at three different depths. Larval fish were identified down to the family level, and I analysed the seven reef-associated families with the largest sample sizes; Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. Larval fish at each depth were identified to ontogenetic stages described above, and the length measured. While there have been many larval fish assemblage studies off the New South Wales (NSW) coast [@gray1993; @dempster1997; @matis2014], no earlier study has specifically investigated the OVM patterns of reef fish. The effect of oceanographic features on connectivity pattern was another consideration, with the aim to see if the ontogenetic distribution changed when larval fish were in coastal waters entrained by the East Australia Current or within an eddy.

Chapter 4 is a theoretical modelling study, using a BDM to investigate the effect on connectivity patterns of several different behaviours: passive movement, vertical advection (VA), diel vertical migration (DVM), OVM, and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS). I developed a BDM using the recommendations of @north2009 and built upon other recent publications. Understanding important behaviours to model allows us to know which behaviours to implement and where to focus the empirical research. The second aim of this chapter was to gain an understanding of the sensitivity of a larval fish behaviour (i.e. OVM) to different parameter values and methods of implementation. Gaining insight into the importance of parameter choice helps us understand the impacts of making assumptions to parameterise models when empirical knowledge of a behaviour for a particular species is not available in from the literature.

The final chapter synthesised the results of each of the previous data chapters to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii*, a threatened reef fish endemic to NSW. I used the BDM developed for Chapter 3, configured to use the important behavioural traits for dispersal models identified in Chapters 2 and 4, and parameterised using the vertical distribution data gathered for Serranidae in Chapter 3. The larval dispersal patterns were generated during known spawning times across the eight-year period (2004-2011) and across the known distribution within Australia. Comparisons were made between the connectivity patterns seen with larvae spawned across the known distribution, and larvae spawned from only regions with known aggregating populations. Finally, these connectivity patterns were compared to the current legislated network of marine protected areas, both under state and federal jurisdiction, to identify if there are areas not currently protected that might assist *E. daemelii* in population recovery.
