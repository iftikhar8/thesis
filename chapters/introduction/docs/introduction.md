General Introduction
====================

Marine populations are structurally different to terrestrial populations as the conditions of the fluid environment typically favour open populations [@caley1996; @figueira2006]. The ocean is a dynamic system with currents dispersing eggs or larvae over potentially considerable distances, creating interconnected regions. Larval dispersal has been a topic of interest in marine ecology for over a century [@hjort1914; @hjort1926]. Traditionally the focus has been on larval supply and recruitment dynamics [@underwood1984; @gaines1985; @victor1983; @doherty1991], however, recent advancements in the field have allowed us to investigate the origin of recruited larvae, revealing these systems are not as open as previously thought [@jones2005; @swearer1999a; @cowen2000]. The spatial extent of this dispersal and the connectivity between areas are key questions within the field of marine ecology.

Connectivity, within the context of this thesis, is defined as the exchange of individuals between spatially discrete populations [@palumbi2003; @cowen2009]. A metapopulation is defined as the collection of connected populations [@hanski1998]. In the marine context, the primary mechanism of connectivity for metapopulations is via the processes of dispersal and recruitment of larvae [@sale2006a]. Connectivity within a metapopulation can be highly volatile due to events that are intrinsic [e.g. low exchange of individuals; @castorani2017] or extrinsic [e.g. natural variation in currents; @watson2012]. The connectivity between populations is fundamental to community dynamics (local and metapopulation levels), genetic diversity and population persistence [@burgess2014; @lowe2010; @lett2015]. However, the influence of biological processes that contribute to this connectivity, the importance of variable connectivity on population dynamics, and the general dispersal patterns for many larval fishes are not fully understood [@cowen2007; @giangrande2017; @snyder2015]

The central aim of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the processes that influence the [**Minor** 1101]{.comment-start id="1101" author="Reviewer 1"} dispersal of larval fish and connectivity patterns between populations.[]{.comment-end id="1101"} The thesis has four parts:

* a meta-analysis comparing studies to assess the trends and influence of biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) structure and parameters on resulting connectivity patterns.

* an empirical evaluation of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) patterns of larval fish, a key biological process known to influence connectivity.

* an investigation of the influences of different behaviours, strategies and modelling choices on connectivity patterns using a BDM.

* an application of a BDM, incorporating outcomes from previous chapters, to predict connectivity patterns and appropriateness of current marine protected area strategy for the threatened black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) of the temperate region of south-eastern Australia.

Larval fish dispersal
---------------------

Many marine species, such as the archetypal example of reef fish, experience a two-stage lifecycle, initially in a pelagic larval stage and then transition into a [**Minor** 3101]{.comment-start id="3101" author="Reviewer 3"}sedentary[]{.comment-end id="3101"} adult stage [@sale1991]. The differences in morphology, habitat, and behaviour between these two stages of larval fish development can be striking [@leis2000; [**Minor** 3102]{.comment-start id="3102" author="Reviewer 3"}@leis2002[]{.comment-end id="3102"}]. The sedentary nature of the adult stage for marine species with this dual lifecycle, results in connectivity between discrete populations (and within metapopulations) occurring predominantly during this pelagic larval phase (which can last from days to weeks), unlike terrestrial animals where this connectivity occurs more typically by adult migration [@cowen2007]. Because pelagic larvae can disperse over vast distances of up to hundreds or even thousands of kilometres, rigorous quantification of connectivity patterns can be difficult [@levin2006]. The closest terrestrial example is seed dispersal, but unlike seeds, fish larvae have natural behaviours that can influence their dispersal [@cowen2009].

Most reef fish are oviparous â€” females either lay their eggs attached to a benthic substrate (e.g. rock or plant) or broadcast spawn them for males to fertilise. Fecundity can range from [**Minor** 3103]{.comment-start id="3103" author="Reviewer 3"}tens to thousands to millions of eggs per spawning event []{.comment-end id="3103"}[@sadovy1996], a strategy, which offsets the extremely high mortality rate for larval fish [i.e. [**Minor** 1102]{.comment-start id="1102" author="Reviewer 1"}estimated to range from above 85%; []{.comment-end id="1102"} @white2014; @johnson2015 to higher than 99.95%; @houde1989; @mcgurk1986]. Upon hatching, larval fish are not fully developed and undergo morphological changes before becoming a settlement stage juvenile [@leis2000]. The ontogenetic stages of larval fish are described around the development of the caudal fin, a process called flexion. Flexion is defined as the point in development at which the notochord of a larval fish starts bending upwards at approximately 45 degrees to begin the formation of the caudal fin. The development of the caudal fin allows larvae to develop [**Minor** 3104]{.comment-start id="3104" author="Reviewer 3"}meaningful[]{.comment-end id="3104"} swimming abilities and transform from a planktonic to a nektonic state [@leis2006]. The period from hatching until flexion is defined as preflexion, and postflexion describes the period after the caudal fin has developed, but before the [**Minor** 3105]{.comment-start id="3105" author="Reviewer 3"}juvenile stage that starts when metamorphosis is complete.[]{.comment-end id="3105"} The period the fish spends in this larval stage is called the pelagic larval duration (PLD). The PLD ends when the larvae [**Minor** 3106]{.comment-start id="3106" author="Reviewer 3"}settlement occurs[]{.comment-end id="3106"}, which requires them to be developed enough to swim and sense suitable settlement habitat. The [**Minor** 3107]{.comment-start id="3107" author="Reviewer 3"}length of the PLD is species-specific[]{.comment-end id="3107"}, but despite some variability, there is typically similarity [**Minor** 3108]{.comment-start id="3108" author="Reviewer 3"}within the lower taxonomic level such as genus or family[]{.comment-end id="3108"} [@victor2000; @wilson1999]. Variation within PLDs arises due to individual larva having flexibility in the timing of settlement, [**Minor** 3109]{.comment-start id="3109" author="Reviewer 3"}although there are certain physiological limitations (e.g. temperature or food availability) and genetic limitations[]{.comment-end id="3109"} on both the earliest and latest time a larva can settle. [**Minor** 1103]{.comment-start id="1103" author="Reviewer 1"}The settlement competencies required during this metamorphosis for larval fish to settle include the development of functioning fins, larger body size and increased muscle mass, and sensory abilities to allow for navigation and habitat selection[]{.comment-end id="1103"} [@montgomery2006; @leis2006; @dixson2014].

[**Minor** 1108]{.comment-start id="1108" author="Reviewer 1"}Dispersal of larval fish, and the subsequent patterns of dispersal, are driven by the interface of a complex series of physical and biological processes[]{.comment-end id="1108"}. Dispersal begins with a spawning event, the timing and location of which [**Minor** 1104]{.comment-start id="1104" author="Reviewer 1"} are two strong drivers that influence the dispersal pattern[]{.comment-end id="1104"} [@puckett2014; @bauer2015; @donahue2015]. The most [**Minor** 3111]{.comment-start id="3111" author="Reviewer 3"}significant process that contributes to the connectivity between discrete populations is the dispersal by ocean currents.[]{.comment-end id="3111"} Entrainment in oceanographic features, such as mesoscale eddies, can influence dispersal by changing the direction and increasing development of larvae [@graber1997; @shulzitski2015]. Dispersal can be driven by the length of the PLD [**Minor** 1106]{.comment-start id="1106" author="Reviewer 1"}by allowing larvae more time to decide where to settle[]{.comment-end id="1106"}; however, [**Minor** 3112]{.comment-start id="3112" author="Reviewer 3"}PLD has not been shown to be a strong predictor[]{.comment-end id="3112"} of dispersal distance [@koeck2015; @treml2012; @mora2012]. It is now understood that fish larvae are not passively advected, and [**Minor** 3113]{.comment-start id="3113" author="Reviewer 3"}larval fish[]{.comment-end id="3113"} develop behaviours that can influence the pattern of dispersal once released into the [**Minor** 3114]{.comment-start id="3114" author="Reviewer 3"}pelagic environment[]{.comment-end id="3114"}. [**Minor** 1107]{.comment-start id="1107" author="Reviewer 1"}Potential evidence[]{.comment-end id="1107"} of active dispersal include the ability of larval fish to recruit with siblings [@ottmann2016] and high self-recruitment and local retention [@jones1999; @swearer1999a; @paris2004], even for larval fish with long PLDs. Vertical migration (diel and ontogenetic) is one such behaviour that allows larval fish to [**Minor** 3115]{.comment-start id="3115" author="Reviewer 3"}influence[]{.comment-end id="3115"} their dispersal distance by moving away from wind-driven surface currents [@paris2004]. Reaching the developmental stage of flexion [**Minor** 3116]{.comment-start id="3116" author="Reviewer 3"}enables[]{.comment-end id="3116"} larvae to start swimming, often at speeds greater than the encompassing current advecting them [@fisher2000]. Larval fish develop a suite of senses that allow them to detect and swim in the direction of settlement habitat [@gerlach2007; @bottesch2016]. One thought is that larvae must be close to some available settlement habitat before the end of their pelagic larval duration or they die [@cowen2009], [**Minor** 3117]{.comment-start id="3117" author="Reviewer 3"} however, this is far from certain.[]{.comment-end id="3117"}

The importance of connectivity for fish populations
---------------------------------------------------

Alongside births and deaths, population connectivity is the process that defines the dynamics of both local and metapopulations [@figueira2006]. Metapopulation persistence relies on a constant degree of connectivity to occur [@botsford2006]. Local populations [discrete subpopulations within a metapopulation, ignoring the movement of adults; @grimm2003] that are demographically connected rely on stable connectivity from source populations to persist [@lowe2010]. Variability in connectivity between populations has long-term consequences for metapopulation growth [@watson2012; @williams2013]. This thesis focuses on ecologically relevant connectivity, i.e. demographic connectivity whereby dispersal affects population growth and persistence [@gotelli1991], and not genetic connectivity, which requires only a few individuals to be exchanged [**Minor** 3118]{.comment-start id="3118" author="Reviewer 3"}per generation[]{.comment-end id="3118"} [@slatkin1993].

[**Minor** 1109]{.comment-start id="1109" author="Reviewer 1"}Understanding connectivity of marine systems[]{.comment-end id="1109"} is paramount for the conservation and management of metapopulations [@crooks2006; @roberts1997; @botsford2006; @lester2009]. An important instrument in the marine conservation toolbox is the marine protected area [MPA; @halpern2003; @lubchenco2003; @mellin2016; @gaines2010], which can be effective if designed with clear conservation goals [@saarman2013]. Marine protected area is a broad term that refers to conservation areas with potentially different spatial zoning, ranging from "no take areas" or marine reserves to mixed use zones that allow recreational fishing and boating activities [@mccook2010]. Historically, habitat quality and habitat preservation have been the primary priorities for marine conservation and connectivity has often been overlooked [@crowder2006], habitat preservation does not provide the same ability as well connected networks of protected areas for populations to recover from disturbance [@almany2009]. Therefore, to address population persistence, connectivity is now considered an essential requirement when designing MPAs [@botsford2009; @christie2010; @abesamis2016; @jonsson2016a; @smith2018; @bode2016]. The design and planning of marine protected areas is critical to their success [@botsford2001; @claudet2008] and as such, understanding the dispersal patterns of marine species across their entire life-cycle is critical for the design of MPA networks [@gruss2011; @lockwood2002; @breen2015; @weeks2017]. Dispersal information is essential in understanding the spatial connectivity between MPAs in a network [@shanks2003; @carr2017; @schill2015; @warner2000], and also to assess the connectivity to other non-protected marine areas [@pelc2010; @harrison2012]. However, designing a unified network is not without its difficulty [@kendall2015; @watson2012; @coleman2017] or controversy [@roff2014] as marine species have different dispersal distances and the natural variation of extrinsic factors, and carrying capacity has the potential to be more important than connectivity [@cabral2016]. To address the temporal flux seen in connectivity patterns within MPAs [@fox2016], the conservation management paradigm of dynamic marine protected systems has also been considered [@smith2007; @soria2014]. [**Minor** 2103]{.comment-start id="2103" author="Reviewer 2"}Dynamic protected areas are well established[]{.comment-end id="2103"} in some smaller artisanal fishing communities [@cinner2012] and can be effectively used to manage fisheries and increase populations of targeted species [@game2009; @hobday2006; @ban2011].

Measuring larval fish connectivity
-------------------------------------

Connectivity is one of the more challenging problems to study empirically in marine ecology [@cowen2009]. Directly measuring larval fish connectivity with [**Minor** 3119]{.comment-start id="3119" author="Reviewer 3"}modern[]{.comment-end id="3119"} techniques is often challenging or impractical [and often impossible pending technological advancement in remote sensing; @witman2015]. Larvae are minuscule (measured in mm) and exist within a vast oceanic environment. Larval fish are inherently difficult to track due to the combination of PLD ranging from weeks to months that allows them to disperse long distances [@victor2000] and high mortality rate â€” meaning only a fraction of the total spawned larvae will settle [@houde1989]. Despite these difficulties, there are several direct and indirect methods for measuring dispersal using both natural and physical tags [@thorrold2007; @jones2009].

Natural markers are ubiquitous amongst larval fish [@campana2001; @kennedy1997], which makes them experimentally advantageous. Genetic material is the most common natural marker used to measure connectivity [@hedgecock2007]. There are several different methodologies for measuring dispersal using genetics, e.g. using genetic markers to compare gene flow between populations [@crandall2012; @serrano2016; @hepburn2009] or using parentage analysis to determine where progeny recruit [@jones2005; @berumen2012; @planes2009]. Population-level gene flow is an indirect measure that requires less sampling effort, leading to a broader use amongst studies. Quantifying connectivity through gene flow involves comparing genetic microsatellite markers to determine if spatially discrete populations share genetic material [@doherty1995; @curley2009; @foster2012]. The caveat to describing connectivity using gene flow is that only information on historical dispersal events [**Minor** 3120]{.comment-start id="3120" author="Reviewer 3"}(genetic connectivity)[]{.comment-end id="3120"} can be determined. Therefore, it is uncertain if larval connectivity occurred directly between two populations or indirectly through one or more connected populations. Parentage analysis, on the other hand, gives direct evidence of dispersal events but it requires onerous sampling of parents and progeny. This technique uses genetic markers to identify the natal population of new recruits giving estimates of dispersal distance [@williamson2016; @berumen2012; @planes2009], and with sufficient sampling can indicate the level of self-recruitment in populations [@jones2005; @herrera2016]. The level of sampling difficulty increases when considering wider spatial or longer temporal extents. However, new methodologies have shown that dispersal kernels can be [**Minor** 3121]{.comment-start id="3121" author="Reviewer 3"}realistically estimated[]{.comment-end id="3121"} by sampling only 3% of the population [@bode2018]. Determining connectivity through genetic markers is a continually changing field, with recent advancements giving the potential for greater insight into the dispersal movement between populations, e.g. genetic assignment tests on allele frequencies [@simpson2014].

A non-genetic natural marker for measuring the dispersal of larval fish is the elemental composition of an otolith, which can have markers of the surrounding chemical compositions of the water where the fish was spawned [@campana1999; @thorrold2001; @swearer1999a]. This technique has been used successfully to link adults with their juvenile nurseries in estuaries [@gillanders2003; @kennedy1997]. For this technique to be useful, the spatial regions of interest must have identifiably different chemical signatures; otherwise, the exact birth location can be hard to ascertain [@thorrold2002]. An inherent difficulty with this technique is that in marine and freshwater systems, the environmental markers are in constant flux [@swearer2003] and therefore constant monitoring must [**Minor** 2105]{.comment-start id="2105" author="Reviewer 2"}occur to[]{.comment-end id="2105"} confidently predict dispersal using otoliths [@gillanders2002].

Techniques for physical markers on larval fish have developed in the last 15 years that allow direct measurement for connectivity [@cowen2009]. Physical tagging can be applied using fluorescent chemical markers [@jones1999; @thorrold2002; @jones2005], staining clutches of eggs that provides information about the connectivity from a single location. Trans-generational marking, a technique less [**Minor** 3122]{.comment-start id="3122" author="Reviewer 3"}labour-intensive[]{.comment-end id="3122"} than fluorescent marking, involves injecting adult breeding females with enriched stable-isotopes (e.g. ^137^Ba) that are passed onto each spawned egg and are incorporated into the otolith of the larvae [@thorrold2006]. Dispersal can be measured by sampling recruits and detecting the stable isotope in the otolith. Studies have used this technique effectively to investigate connectivity of reef fish populations over small spatial scales [@almany2007] and comparing inter-annual variability [albeit with exhaustive sampling; @cuif2015]. The advantages of trans-generational marking are that marking one female, in turn, tags each egg produced (for a period), reducing the number of adults required to mark, and that by using different concentrations of the stable-isotope, different locations can be discerned. The direct and indirect empirical methods described above can give accurate measurements of dispersal success and distance over smaller spatial scales but become almost impossible when considering long dispersal distances, e.g. coastal extents. Additionally, low sample sizes lead to a lot of uncertainty in the results of these empirical methods, although statistical tools have been developed to address these issues [@kaplan2017].

[**Minor** 1110]{.comment-start id="1110" author="Reviewer 1"}Biophysical dispersal models (BDM)[]{.comment-end id="1110"} are an alternative method to empirical measurement to predict potential connectivity patterns [@paris2007; @sponaugle2002]. Consisting of coupled physical and biological models, BDMs reflect the complex interaction of processes on larval dispersal patterns. The physical model used in a BDM a numerical hydrodynamic model, often combined with data assimilation techniques of observation systems to resolve mesoscale and sub-mesoscale oceanographic processes, e.g., fronts and eddies. Open ocean circulation models are well understood; however, the near-shore dynamics (interaction of cross-shore and along-shore processes) are not as established [**Minor** 3123]{.comment-start id="3123" author="Reviewer 3"}due to their inherent complexity and variability[]{.comment-end id="3123"} [@largier2003]. Compared to our understanding of oceanographic processes, the fundamentals of many biological processes are not well understood. As our understanding of the early-life history of [**Minor** 3124]{.comment-start id="3124" author="Reviewer 3"}fishes[]{.comment-end id="3124"} (and other marine species) has progressed, the biological models in BDMs have increased in complexity. Individual-based models are the most common variant of BDMs, whereby the model advects individual larva encapsulating biological traits and behaviours through the hydrodynamic matrix. The biological models are often species-specific, using information gained from empirical studies of the early-life history for that particular species, but sometimes using general information to describe a suite of species. Studies using species-specific models are often difficult due to the lack of available information on the early-life history of many species, and often many assumptions must be made [@leis2007b]. Therefore, identifying key biological processes influencing connectivity and information on larval fish behaviour are important areas of research.

Inferring patterns of larval dispersal using BDMs is a cost effective tool compared to the empirical methods described above. Modelling provides the ability to manipulate parameters, and therefore ask questions that cannot be easily achieved with empirical methods, e.g. changing spatial extents ranging from localised reefs [@andutta2012] to global spatial scales [@wood2013; @treml2015] and changing temporal scales from intra-annual [@robins2013] to inter-annual [@young2012]. Manipulating parameters allows for exploration of the influence of physical and biological processes and biological traits on connectivity, something that is difficult to measure empirically. These modelled patterns of connectivity, combined with other empirical measures of dispersal, provide a powerful tool for the inference of larval connectivity [@werner2007; @coscia2012; @foster2012; @crochelet2013]. Studies measuring larval dispersal have been utilising BDMs for over three decades [@wroblewski1982; @bartsch1988], with increasing complexity being built into the models over time [@cowen2009; @werner2007; @miller2007; @willis2011; @lett2009]. These models have been successfully used to assist in the design and planning of well-connected MPAs [@coleman2017; @andrello2013; @jonsson2016a] and in understanding the larval dispersal of commercially important fisheries [@incze2010; @garcia-garcia2016; @kough2013]. The results of models are predictive only, and qualification on applications of these models is justified. Research must also focus on the validation of these models, considering the input parameters, the modelled processes, and the predicted connectivity patterns.

Thesis outline
--------------

[**Minor** 1111]{.comment-start id="1111" author="Reviewer 1"}The primary objective of this thesis was to investigate the processes[]{.comment-end id="1111"}, principally biological and behavioural, that influence the dispersal and connectivity patterns of larval fish. Three decades of research using BDMs have given many of examples of major findings and advances in connectivity research [@miller2007; @willis2011; @cowen2009]. As with any cohesive field of research, there is a common aim to advance our overall understanding of the discipline finding generalities across studies, yet often results are conflicting [@leis2010]. This topic was explored using four interrelated data chapters. The first data chapter is a meta-analysis, evaluating published BDMs and identifying modelling decisions (both physical and biological), with the aim of building upon a previous review by @miller2007. The first aim of the chapter was to identify trends in the inclusion and exclusion of modelling parameters, with the goal of understanding if there is a minimum suite of parameters that should be included in future BDM studies. More importantly, the second aim of the chapter was to understand the consequences of modelling choices on the resulting connectivity patterns. Common metrics were identified and compared across different parameter choices to understand the effects. These results provide a template for BDMs in the future by highlighting the outcomes of modelling choice and identifying knowledge gaps in important parameter choices.

The impetus for Chapter 3 was the knowledge gaps in the empirical data on the OVM patterns of larval fishes found along the eastern coast of Australia. Vertical migration, the ability of fish larvae to change position in the water column, is known to [**Minor** 3125]{.comment-start id="3125" author="Reviewer 3"}indirectly[]{.comment-end id="3125"} influence connectivity patterns by acting as a retention mechanism and limiting dispersal [@paris2004]. Knowledge gaps on OVM patterns can hinder connectivity research on specific species, [**Minor** 3126]{.comment-start id="3126" author="Reviewer 3"}as BDMs can be forced to either exclude or at best use hypothetical OVM behaviour[]{.comment-end id="3126"} if no empirical information is available. Even with the information that is available on species, generalising within species, between species, and across regions is fraught with difficulties due to the variability in behavioural traits [@leis2007b]. OVM is considered an important process in the [**Minor** 3127]{.comment-start id="3127" author="Reviewer 3"}dispersal[]{.comment-end id="3127"} of larval fish [@paris2007], and therefore I decided to gather data on these patterns for reef fish off the eastern coast of Australia. The experiment consisted of 16 sites, sampling larval fish at three different depths. Larval fish were identified down to the family level, and I analysed the seven reef-associated families with the largest sample sizes; Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, and Synodontidae. Larval fish at each depth were identified to the ontogenetic stages described above, and the length measured. While there have been many larval fish assemblage studies off the New South Wales (NSW) coast [@gray1993; @dempster1997; @matis2014], [**Minor** 3128]{.comment-start id="3128" author="Reviewer 3"}only one study has specifically investigated the OVM patterns of some reef fish families[]{.comment-end id="3128"} [@leis2006b]. The effect of oceanographic features on connectivity pattern was another consideration, with the aim to see if the ontogenetic distribution changed when larval fish were in coastal waters entrained by the East Australia Current or within an eddy.

Chapter 4 is a theoretical modelling study, using a BDM to investigate the effect on connectivity patterns of several different behaviours: [**Minor** 3129]{.comment-start id="3129" author="Reviewer 3"}passive movement (restricted to the surface), vertical advection (passive movement with no vertical restriction; VA)[]{.comment-end id="3129"}, diel vertical migration (DVM), OVM, and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS). I developed a BDM using the recommendations of @north2009 and built upon other recent publications. Understanding which behaviours are important to connectivity allows us to focus empirical research on gathering information about these behaviours that can then be used in a modelling context. The second aim of this chapter was to gain an understanding of the sensitivity of larval fish behaviour (i.e. OVM) to different parameter values and methods of implementation. Gaining insight into the importance of parameter choice helps us understand the impacts of making assumptions to parameterise models when empirical knowledge of behaviour for a particular species is not available in from the literature.

The final chapter synthesised the results of each of the previous data chapters to investigate the connectivity of *E. daemelii*, a threatened reef fish endemic to NSW. I used the BDM developed for Chapter 3, configured to use the important behavioural traits for dispersal models identified in Chapters 2 and 4, and parameterised using the vertical distribution data gathered for Serranidae in Chapter 3. The larval dispersal patterns were generated during known spawning times across the eight-year period (2004-2011) and across the known distribution within Australia. Comparisons were made between the connectivity patterns seen with larvae spawned across the known distribution, and larvae spawned from only regions with known aggregating populations. Finally, these connectivity patterns were compared to the current legislated network of marine protected areas, both under state and federal jurisdiction, to identify if there are areas not currently protected that might assist *E. daemelii* in population recovery.

The oversimplified assumption that larval fish are passive actors to the surrounding oceanography during their pelagic larval stage has been debunked [@leis2006]. Furthering our understanding of larval fish behaviours and how much they affect connectivity is now a primary research focus. Through these four sections, this thesis endeavours to advance our understanding using a combination of experimental techniques to measure ontogenetic vertical migration distributions and theoretical modelling for assessing impacts of larval behaviours on connectivity patterns.
