# Comparing the influence of the implementation of different larval behavioural strategies on connectivity patterns in biophysical dispersal models

## Introduction

### Background on Migration behaviours affecting connectivity

Recent empirical studies have demonstrated how pelagic larval fish, far from being passive as previously thought, can exhibit a variety of behaviours to influence where they settle [@leis2006]. The swimming behaviours of larval fish that are able to influence the dispersal paths are; vertical migration—ontogenetic [@paris2004a] and diel [@huebert2011]—and orientated horizontal swimming [ towards preferred settlement habitat @gerlach2007a]. These behaviours allow ichthyoplankton to remain closer to the natal reef, by avoiding strong wind-driven surface currents advecting them away, and by swimming in the direction of identifiable reef using cues (e.g. their natal reef). However, understanding the effect of these migration behaviours on the entire connectivity across a region is difficult to do empirically [@Cowen:2009fm]. Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM), using coupled physical (hydrodynamics) and biological (larval behaviour) models, is a useful tool, allowing inference on the influence of these process on the marine larval dispersal [@werner2007].

As our understanding of ichthyoplankton behavioural abilities during their early-life history develops, understanding how these behaviours influence their dispersal becomes an important question. BDM studies provide us a mechanism to model the complex behaviour of larval fish and understand how different behavioural characteristics influence dispersal patterns, with the intention of increasing the accuracy and precision of the modelled patterns. Currently there is no consensus on the importance of behaviours to include within model, and it is difficult to compare across studies due to the large number of variables. Often the limiting factor to including behaviour is the requirement to make assumptions due to unknown behavioural traits of specific species of interest. Modelling studies have implemented different migration behaviours; ontogenetic [@paris2007a], diel [@aiken2011], and orientated horizontal swimming [@staaterman2012], and found that all influence connectivity patterns by reducing dispersal distance and increasing local retention. The problem for modellers and empirical researchers is to decide where to focus both the models (i.e. what behaviours are most important to include) and empirical research (i.e. what data should we be focused on collecting to parameterise these models). Even when there is consensus on the importance of a specific behaviour on connectivity, i.e. ontogenetic vertical migration, there is often only empirical data for a few species available in the literature. Modellers are forced to choose between limiting the behaviour [@andrello2013], using generalisations or substitute species [@young2012], or parameterising the model with generic larval traits and not a particular species or taxa [@corell2012]. The other decision modellers are required to make is how to model the processes that drive the behaviour. Due to the difficulty of obtaining field data, this information is often unknown, leading to assumptions, e.g. how do larvae vertically migrate with ontogeny - is it a slow or fast process, or when larvae are getting advected by offshore currents - do they swim at a speeds closer as observed in flow chambers [@fisher2000] or *in situ* close to settlement reefs [@leis1997].

To inform on the relative influence of different migrations behaviours, to prioritise modelling and empirical effort, the first aim of this study is to compare how the swimming behaviours; ontogenetic vertical migration, diel vertical migration, and orientated horizontal swimming, affect the connectivity patterns using a biophysical dispersal model. To investigate this aim, the biological model was parameterised using the well studied early life history of Pomacentridae larvae, using common reef fish species found within the study region, New South Wales (NSW, Australia). The study region was arbitrarily chosen and is notable for its poleward near-shore boundary current. The hypothesis is that all behaviours (and combinations of) will influence the connectivity patterns, compared to no swimming behaviour. Further, it is predicted that vertical migration will have a stronger effect than horizontal swimming due to the longer timeframe vertical migration can influence dispersal throughout the pelagic larval stage. Vertical migration occurs from an early onset of ontogeny, and changing position in the water column allows larvae to be advected by currents with different directions and velocities. In contrast, for horizontal swimming to influence connectivity patterns, the larvae has to be competent to settle, and within a sensory distance of the reef in order to orientate and swim towards the settlement habitat.

Ontogenetic vertical migration of larval fish is a well understood early-life history behaviour [@leis2006], and has been included in many modelling studies [@holstein2014; @donahue2015; @rochette2012]. Although the exact mechanisms behind this movement with ontogeny are less understood [@Irisson:2010um]. The second aim of this study is to investigate how different implementation methods (modelling choices) and strategies (reflecting species differences) of ontogenetic vertical migration affect connectivity patterns. The first part of the aim will answer the question about how connectivity patterns are affected by small changes in parameters, giving modellers an idea about how small changes in OVM values change the underlying dispersal patterns. Using OVM data collected in Chapter 3, models will use the different OVM patterns found for the seven fish families. It is expected that different strategies will significantly effect the dispersal, as the position in the water column determines the speed and direction the larvae is advected. The second part of this aim, will give insight about the effect of modelling choices on the connectivity output. To implement a behaviour, modellers are required to make decisions on the processes of the behaviour which may not yet be fully understood and therefore assumptions are required, which may lead to changes in dispersal patterns. To investigate this second part, three different methods of ontogenetically migrating the larvae were compared, using fast to slow changes in vertical position. The prediction is that while different methods of the same behaviour (using the same pattern of OVM), patterns of migration and not process should be the main driver, and therefore the resultant connectivity patterns should be similar. All derived potential connectivity patterns were compared using both multivariate and univariate analysis to understand the influence of behaviours.

## Methods

### Model development

The biophysical dispersal model—Zooplankton Interconnections and Source-Sink Observation Utility [ZISSOU, v1.1.4; @hawes2018]—is an individual-based model (IBM) developed in accordance with recommendations from the “Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life” [@north2009]. The major processes captured by ZISSOU and described in the flow chart shown in @fig:flowchart. Movement of particles within the model is forced by offline oceanographic current data but can be influenced by larval behavioural traits parameterised using probability distributions capturing known biological variability. The system was designed for high-performance, high customisation, and platform independence; written in the language Scala (v2.12.4; http://www.scala-lang.org) using parallel libraries for scalability.

![The flow chart of ZISSOU (Zooplankton Interconnections and Source-Sink Observation Utility), the biophysical dispersal model used in this study, highlighting the major processes used to dispersal the larvae using both physical and biological processes. The biological model is highlighted by the yellow background (DVM = diel vertical migration, OHS = orientated horizontal swimming, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration).](chapters/theoretical/figs/flow-chart.png){#fig:flowchart}

#### Physical sub-model

ZISSOU accesses ocean circulation or hydrodynamic data as network common data forms (NetCDF); self-describing, machine-independent data formats. The data can be accessed either using locally stored files or using the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP; http://www.opendap.org). This project took advantage of Java NetCDF software libraries developed by UCAR/Unidata (http://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6). The ocean data must be in an Arakawa-A or Arakawa-B grid structure [@arakawa1997]. Currently ZISSOU utilises the 3-dimensional velocity fields of hydrodynamic models only, with environmental variables such as salinity or temperature to be incorporated into future versions.

Runge-Kutta fourth-order integration (RK4) is the ordinary differential equations solver used to move the particle through space and time [@north2009], calculating a weighted average of four increments using the chosen model time-step (@eq:rk4). The velocity at any given position in space is interpolated using a tri-cubic interpolation scheme on the hydrodynamic model grid, such that the velocity for a given particle in the oceanographic space is interpolated from neighbouring grids using 64 points (4 x 4 x 4; @eq:interpolation). If this is not possible, for example due to boundary conditions, trilinear interpolation using 8 points (2 x 2 x 2) is substituted.

$$f(x,y,z)=\sum _{{i=0}}^{3}\sum _{{j=0}}^{3}\sum _{{k=0}}^{3}v_{{ijk}}x^{i}y^{j}z^{k}$${#eq:interpolation}

The velocity *v* at the point *(x,y,z)*, where *x* is the longitude, *y* is the latitude, and *z* is the depth is interpolated using the 64 nearest neighbours.

$$\overrightarrow{v_{t+h}} = \overrightarrow{v_{t}} + \frac{1}{6} (k_{1} + 2k_{2} + 2k_{3} + k_{4})h$${#eq:rk4}
$$k_{1} = f(x_{0(t)},y_{0(t)},z_{0(t)})$$
$$k_{2} = f(x_{1(t + \frac{1}{2}h)}, y_{1(t + \frac{1}{2}h)}, z_{1(t + \frac{1}{2}h)})$$
$$k_{3} = f(x_{2(t + \frac{1}{2}h)}, y_{2(t + \frac{1}{2}h)}, z_{2(t + \frac{1}{2}h)})$$
$$k_{4} = f(x_{3(t + h)}, y_{3(t + h)}, z_{3(t + h)})$$

The integrated velocity vector (*v~t+h~*), at time *t* and time step *h* is calculated using the weighted average of the four seperate interpolations (*k~1~, k~2~, k~3~, k~4~*), which interpolate the velocities at the beginning of the time step, two midpoint approximations and the end of the time step. The tri-cubic interpolation function *f(x,y,z)* calculates the velocities as described above (@eq:interpolation).

To model the natural turbulent effect of ocean systems in a 3D stochastic model, ZISSOU uses a random displacement mechanism [@eq:turb; @brickman2002; @north2009].

$$D_{(h+1)} = D_{(h)} + \overrightarrow{v} +\Delta{h} + \sqrt{\frac{2K}{\Delta{h}}Z}$${#eq:turb}

The displacement *D* is added to the velocity vector *v* from the hydrodynamic model, the time step *Δh*, the eddy diffusivity *K* and a random number *Z* from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero.

Psuedo-random numbers are generated in the model using a Mersenne Twister algorithm, WELL44497b [@panneton2006]. The seed for the random number generator is an optional parameter of the model to allow for reproducibility of results if needed.

#### Biological sub-model

Biological traits are specified using a configurable XML file as input to the model. The biological model implements many biological processes that are considered to be important for marine larval dispersal, e.g. the spawning period, pelagic larval duration (PLD), and vertical migration (@tbl:bio-params). The pelagic larval duration is specified by the length of the larval period in days. Larvae can be assigned a non-settlement competency period, whereby they cannot settle before a specified number of days, otherwise they attempt to settle upon reaching their PLD. Spawning sites are given as GPS locations (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees), with spawning time and frequency, the spawning depth in the water column, and the number of larvae to spawn, are being options which can be tailored to the modelled marine species. The particles seeded in the model are referred to as larvae, but can also simulate pelagic eggs through the inclusion of a specific age stage. The ichthyoplankton developmental stages (hatching, preflexion, flexion, postflexion) are based on a description of the mean (± standard deviation) age (in days) of larvae of each stage. From this input, stage transition ages (day at which the larvae transitions from one developmental stage to another) are assigned to individual larvae at birth using a Gaussian distribution (if no standard deviation is specified, the mean is the value).

|  | In situ swimming speed  | The swimming speed of the fish larvae recorded by divers *in situ* as a proportion of the *U~crit~* |  Proportion
|  | Swimming endurance  | The proportion of time the fish can spend swimming  | Proportion

Settlement sites are represented as GIS polygons within the model, using point in polygon algorithms to determine if larvae are over settlement sites. The polygons are supplied as input in the Shapefile format, a common geospatial vector data format specified by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri; https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf). Larval mortality can be included in the model, specified as a percentage daily rate of mortality applied randomly across the population, a common approach amongst connectivity studies [@butler2011; @kool2011; @treml2015]. Note however for the simulations described in this chapter, no mortality was applied due to the aim of comparing patterns of potential connectivity.

Several behavioural traits for larvae are able to be included in the model including orientated horizontal swimming, vertical migration, and the ability to sense suitable settlement sites (@tbl:bio-params). Vertical migration can be implemented as either diel or ontogenetic vertical migration. Both are based on the probability of being in a specific depth range based on either the time of day (i.e. night or day), or their ontogenetic stage (@fig:ovm-example). The vertical position of a larvae was changed by applying a probability distribution function to determine to which depth the larvae moved. For diel vertical migration this probability distribution function was applied one hour before sunset or sunrise using an approximation calculated using the current latitude / longitude of the larvae.

For ontogenetic vertical migration, there are three choices for the timing of migration; vertically migrating when the next developmental stage is reached [@garcia-garcia2016], daily migration [@puckett2014], or at each time step [within chosen constraints of movement; @paris2007a]. Moving larvae vertically with the onset of ontogenetic stage is the simplest, but creates a stratified larval distribution, assuming a gradual migration strategy with ontogeny. Vertically migrating them every day or time-step creates more random process with a centre of mass at specific depths, and the migration is restricted to distributions based on their ontogeny. These strategies allow for modelling vertical behaviour whereby different species of ichthyoplankton change vertical position restricted or unrestricted by depth.

![Example of ontogenetic vertical migration input for a fish than migrates downwards with ontogeny, where the proportions of larval occurrence at different depths are specified for each stage (preflexion, flexion, and postflexion), and must add up to one for each developmental stage](chapters/theoretical/figs/ovm-example.png){#fig:ovm-example}

The fish larvae can be given a settlement sensory distance which allows them to discover a settlement habitat if that pass within the distance, acting as pseudo-behaviour for cues such as vision, hearing or olfaction [@leis2006; @kingsford2002]. The nearest point on the reef polygon is identified and then the distance is compared to the larva's current position. If there is no settlement site within the distance, then the larvae keeps moving. Olfactory distance works similar to settlement sensory, allowing the larvae to orientate towards the nearest settlement habitat if it is within the specified distance. Reef fish larvae have been shown to smell reefs from distances of several kilometres [@paris2013b]. Larvae can be given a horizontal swimming speed, which if the larvae are within an olfactory distance of a reef, the speed is added to the velocities *u* and *v* with the direction of the reef (@eq:u; @eq:v). The horizontal swimming speed is calculated using the known critical swimming speeds, the *in situ* swimming potential and the swimming endurance of the larvae at postflexion (@eq:swim). Critical swimming speed, *U~crit~*, is a measure of the swimming capacity of the larvae and useful as is not difficult to obtain [@hogan2007], the *in situ* swimming speed which is a measure of larval fish swimming in the ocean by divers and correlated with *U~crit~* [@leis2006a], and endurance is a measure of how long they can keep swimming before tiring. ZISSOU constrains the *U~crit~* speed by known *in situ* speeds for the species, generating a swimming speed between the *U~crit~* as the maximum speed and *in situ* as the minimum speed. Endurance is applied as the proportion of time the larvae can continue swimming per time step.

$$u^{\prime} = u + s \times \cos(\theta)$${#eq:u}

$$v^{\prime} = v + s \times \sin(\theta)$${#eq:v}

$$s = U_{crit} \times X_{[S_{p},1]} \times E_{p}$${#eq:swim}

*U~crit~* is the critical swimming speed (ms^-1^), *X* is a random number with a distribution contrained by a minimum *S~p~*, which is is the *in situ* swimming potential (expressed as a proportion of *U~crit~*) and the maximum of 1, and *E~p~* is the endurance potential (proportion of time step it is expected to swim) of the fish larvae. \theta is the orientated angle towards a sensed settlement habitat.

### Model configuration

#### Study location

The New South Wales (NSW) coastline (2,137 km) was divided into approximately 17 equally sized regions [approximately 125 km each; @fig:release-sites]. Rocky reef patches were identified using freely available benthic data obtained from NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). Within each sub-region, four rocky reef patches (approximately 30 hectares in size) from across the sub-region were chosen as spawning sites. Larvae were released weekly from the centre of each spawning site in batches of 1000 over the period July 2007 to June 2008. In total 3.5 million larvae were released. Larvae were allowed to settle to the identified rocky reef patches or benthic habitat patches marked as unknown, as unmapped patches could be potential rocky reef settlement sites.

![The 17 regions (each containing four rock reef patches) used to spawn the reef fish larvae along the coastline of New South Wales, Australia](chapters/theoretical/figs/release-sites.png){#fig:release-sites}

#### Physical sub-model

The oceanographic circulation model used was BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; @oke2013], a hindcast model based on the Ocean Forecasting Australia Model (OFAM). BRAN is a data-assimilating model that aims to resolve mesoscale eddies in 3-dimensions, at the scale of 10 km in the horizontal (0.1° latitude and longitude) and 5-10 m vertically (15 depth bins between 0 and 105 m). The model consists of mean daily current velocities, sea-level anomaly, sea-surface temperature, and salinity over the period January 1993 to September 2012. An eddy diffusivity value *K* of 300 ms^-1^ was used, as per similar studies in the region [@condie2016; @chiswell2011]. The time-step of the model was two hours.

#### Biological sub-model

Model parameters are based on characteristics of a temperate rock reef fish from the family Pomacentridae (Damselfishes). We chose this group as it is relatively well studied, thus providing reasonable estimates of the various parameters required for modelling. The literature on early-life fish histories is biased towards tropical and sub-tropical species, therefore where values for temperate Pomacentridae were not found, information of tropical larvae was utilised (@tbl:bio-params). An individual larvae only settled at the end of their pelagic larval duration if it was within the settlement sensory distance of suitable settlement habitat. The larvae were spawned in the preflexion stage, assuming a species with benthic eggs which is common for Pomacentridae. The lack of velocity data near the coast is an inherent property of the grid structure of the flow model but one that limiting the ability of fish to settle on some reef patches. In order to compensate for this as well as the coarse 10 km resolution of the oceanographic model, larvae were given a settlement sensory zone of 10 km with which to sense settlement reef habitat, which was slightly larger (but within one standard deviation) than the mean settlement sensory zone of 8.3 km (± 5.2) identified in the review of existing studies presented in Chapter 2 (@tbl:bio-base).

In order to address the first aim of evaluating the influence of different behaviours on connectivity patterns I ran a series of models to compare patterns resulting from the implementation of 1) restricted or unrestricted vertical movement by currents, 2) diel vertical migration (DVM), 2) ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and 3) orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) implemented. Each behaviour (and combination of congruent behaviours) was compared to a base case of passive restricted transport where the larvae are only allowed to change their horizontal position (scenario 1; @tbl:scenarios-behaviour).

: Ten models with combinations of the four different behavioural scenarios were used to test the effects of the four behaviours; No behaviour or orientated horizontal swimming and restricted to moving horizontally or allowed to be advected by the vertical velocity component (models 1,2,5,6), diel vertical migration (DVM; models 3,7,8,10), ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM; models 4,7,9,10), and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS, models 5,6,8,9,10). {#tbl:scenarios-behaviour}

| Model | Restricted | DVM | OVM | OHS |
|:-----:|:----------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|   1   |    Yes     |  —  |  —  |  —  |
|   2   |     No     |  —  |  —  |  —  |
|   3   |     —      | Yes |  —  |  —  |
|   4   |     —      |  —  | Yes |  —  |
|   5   |    Yes     |  —  |  —  | Yes |
|   6   |     No     |  —  |  —  | Yes |
|   7   |     —      | Yes | Yes |  —  |
|   8   |     —      | Yes |  —  | Yes |
|   9   |     —      |  —  | Yes | Yes |
|  10   |     —      | Yes | Yes | Yes |

The first behavioural scenario compares the difference between larvae that are advected with (unrestricted) our without (restricted) the vertical or *w* component of the current velocities. This scenario only applies to models with no other vertical migration component, as DMV and OVM change the vertical position after it has been advected by the *w* vector (@tbl:scenarios-behaviour). For the second scenario, the larvae were given the DVM probabilities for Pomacentridae derived from an ichthyoplankton study in the same oceanic region [@gray1998]. Larvae were migrated using probability distribution function between 25 m bins within the top 100 m of the water column (@tbl:dvm). The OVM strategy used the values for OVM distribution values for Pomacentridae larvae observed in the empirical study described in Chapter 3 (see Supplementary Table S1). The larvae centre of mass moves downwards from the surface during preflexion, to commonly the top 50 m during postflexion. For the OHS scenario, to orientate and swim towards a reef, the larval fish were given an reef sensory range of 10 km, which was the maximum extent used in other studies [@wolanski2014a; @staaterman2012], but we assumed the same sensory cues for the larvae as the settlement sensory extent (@tbl:orientate). The *U~crit~* speed for the larvae was 0.463 ms^-1^, but they were given an *in situ* potential of 25%, therefore the actually swimming speed ranged between (0.463 and 0.116 ms^-1^) and the larvae were able to swim for 50% of the model time step.

The second aim, to assess the impact on connectivity of using different ontogenetic vertical migration parameters was addressed by conducting model runs using proportional depth stage abundance profiles which represented the seven fish families studied in Chapter 3 (@fig:scenarios-ovm; for the actual values see Supplementary Table S1). Ontogenetic vertical migration was implemented such that the larvae moved when they reached their next ontogenetic stage (based on developmental time). Lastly, in order to explore the impact of the OVM implementation strategy on connectivity patterns I compared three different methods of ontogenetic vertical migration (@tbl:scenarios-impl).

![Proportional depth stage abundance profiles for each of the seven fish families evaluated in Chapter 3. Values represent the proportional (within a stage) abundance of each ontogenetic stage (preflexion, flexion, postflexion) within each of three depth ranges (surface: 0-5 m; middle: 6-50 m; deep layer: 51-100 m) and are used to parameterise models run to address Aim 2 of this study.](chapters/theoretical/figs/ovm-strategies.png){#fig:scenarios-ovm}

### Data analysis

Each individual model run produced as output a connectivity matrix, which represents the connectivity between larval source (row~*i*~) and settlement (column~*j*~) regions where each element~*i,j*~ is the proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release period. Multivariate comparisons of connectivity matrices were made using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) which allowed for the assessment of the relative similarity of regional patterns (replicates) across different model scenarios (variables). I used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures to get distance matrices and applied a square root transform to down-weight the influence of highly abundant areas of settlement. There were strong differences in settlement patterns for the different regions due to variations in regional oceanography. These differences are interesting but can serve to swamp the more pertinent comparisons between models. In order to capture these differences between models more explicitly raw settlement proportions were normalised by settlement the proportion values from the passive restricted (no behaviour or vertical migration and there accounts for the variation of surface currents) connectivity matrix. Distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test for the significance of the multivariate settlement patterns for each model within a scenario. PERMANOVA, using the models and regions as fixed factors, tested the hypothesis of settlement patterns for each scenario. Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP)—constrained coordinates analysis allowing for non-Euclidean distances—was used to compare the dissimilarity between models within each scenario, reducing all the source regions settlement patterns to a single point for comparison [@anderson2003]. The significance of the CAP ordination was tested, along with the ordination axes, and both variable addition and deletion (Type I and Type III tests respectively). Total settlement to all regions was used to compare the models with each scenario. To compare patterns of total settlement, cluster analysis (using an average-link clustering method with a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure) and total settlement patterns were tested using constrained coordinates analysis (CCA; using Euclidean distance metrics).

Several univariate measures were extracted from each connectivity matrix: settlement site richness (the number of reefs receiving settlers), Shannon-Weiner diversity of settlement (using number of reefs and total larvae settled per reef), self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, dispersal distance (see Definitions), and connectance (the proportion of the edges connecting natal and settlement sites in a graph compared to the theoretical maximum number of edges). Differences between model scenarios were assessed by comparing each metric amongst different sets of matrices (depending on the aim) with regions (n = 17) as replicates in one-way repeated measure ANOVAs, to account for the regional oceanographic variation in each model. Tukey's HSD post-hoc pairwise tests were used to assess differences amongst regions where ANOVAs were significant (\&alpha = 0.05).

All data analysis was performed using the R statistical programming environment [v3.4.3; @rcoreteam2017]. Some additional packages were used for analysis; *ConnMattTools* [@kaplan2017] to obtain connectivity metrics, *igraph* [@csardi2006] and *NetIndices* [@kones2009] to construct the graphs and obtaining measures of connectance, and *vegan* to calculate dissimilarity matrices, NMDS, PERMANOVA (using the *adonis* function), and CAP analysis [@oksanen2018].

## Results

### Comparison of behavioural scenarios

#### Connectivity patterns

Considering the patterns from each source region to each settlement region (standardised by the restricted passive model), the variation between settlement patterns appeared to be principally driven by regional differences in hydrodynamics (@fig:behaviour-nmds). The regional variation showed a strong geographical gradient exhibited by the horseshoe effect . For each source region (1-17), the settlement patterns of models with orientated horizontal swimming included (OHS) clustered together and were more similar than the other models (@fig:behaviour-nmds). The model with only diel vertical migration (DVM) showed the most dissimilarity to all other behavioural models. PERMANOVA confirmed a significant difference between behavioural models, however it explained only small amount of the variation (R^2^ = 0.01, p \< 0.05). The majority of the variation occurred between source sites (R^2^ = 0.89, p \< 0.05). The effect of behaviour on settlement patterns varied within regions; region 5 had large dissimilarities between all the behaviours, contrasting with region 6, where the settlement patterns were more similar. Regions also varied the dissimilarity between models, regions 1 and 2 had similar groupings of settlement patterns for models including OHS, yet the differences between DVM+OVM+OHS and DVM+OHS was greater for region 2 (@fig:behaviour-nmds).

When normalising the NMDS by the passive restricted model, the differences between models with OHS and without are more distinct (@fig:behaviour-nmds-norm). Passive, DVM, OVM, and DMV+OVM account do not vary much between regions, in contrast to OHS models which show large variation between regions. The variation between models with OHS was not consistent between regions, e.g. at region 6 and 7 DVM+OVM+OHS was more similar to OVM+OHS, but at region 1 and 5 it was more similar to DVM+OHS. For the normalised NMDS, PERMANOVA found no significant difference of behaviour and explained similar amount of variance (R^2^ = 0.03, p > 0.05).

The settlement patterns showed strong clustering of the different behavioural models with OHS compared to the other models, which did not form strong groupings (@fig:behaviour-cap; F~(9,144)~=1.35; p < 0.05). Including behaviour in a model, and different combinations of behaviour, changed the connectivity patterns of the larvae. DVM migration was more dissimilar to passive migration than OVM behavioural model (@fig:behaviour-cap). The most dissimilar models were passive restricted and the model with all three behaviours, DVM+OVM+OHS. Restricting the larvae to the surface or allowing the particle to be moved vertically by the currents produced different connectivity patterns, but if combined with OHS then the connectivity was almost identical. OVM and passive unrestricted had similar connectivity patterns.

#### Total settlement at each region

Comparing the behaviours using the total settlement to each region, cluster analysis of the settlement regions by behavioural models produced two distinct clusters: models with and without OHS (@fig:cluster A). Within the OHS cluster, models without vertical migration behaviour, but restricted or unrestricted were highly similar. The models with OVM and OHS were more similar than models with DVM and OHS. In the non-OHS cluster, the most dissimilar model was DVM. The models with no behaviour grouped together and the models with OVM (@fig:cluster A). Restricting larvae to the surface or not (passive or passive-surface), was as dissimilar to each other as using OVM or including OVM and DVM. However, if OHS was added to the OVM model—as seen in the OHS cluster—then the dissimilarity of settlement patterns with including DVM or not was reduced.

Comparisons of total settlement using Euclidean distances produced still produced two clusters, similar to the analysis on the entire connectivity matrix, but the dissimilarity between models within a cluster varied (@fig:behaviour-cca). The models with OHS are more dissimilar to each other using total settlement and in the other cluster models were more tightly grouped, with the exception of DVM. The variation between behaviour scenario models was explained by a combination of settlement regions (@fig:behaviour-cca). OHS models had increased settlement at regions 1, 2 ,3, and 16 and decreased settlement at the regions 5, 6, and 10.

#### Connectivity metrics

Including behaviour in models increased the self-recruitment compared to no behaviour (F~9,144~ = 12.31, p \< 0.05), except for the OVM unless it was combined with another behaviour (@fig:conn-metrics A). The models with DVM or DVM-OHS had the highest self-recruitment and the lowest variation across regions. The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the passive model restricted to the surface. Similarly local retention increased when including all behaviours except OVM (unless coupled with OHS), in particular, including OHS approximately doubled the local retention (F~9,144~ = 79.24, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B). Larvae that were passive with no vertical restriction or exhibited OVM behaviour had consistently lower local retention values. Including DVM gave rise to the most variation of local retention between regions. The effect of OHS was even starker when considering settlement success, approximately increasing the chances of settlement success by 30% (F~9,144~ = 95.02, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C). Including either OVM or DVM+OVM did not change the settlement success significantly compared to passive larvae. The largest variation in settlement success between regions occurred with larvae were restricted to the surface waters. The dispersal distance for models with OHS behaviour was significantly reduced, approximately 40% the distance that passive larvae dispersed until settlement and with reduced variation (F~9,144~ = 66.33, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The OVM model did not significantly reduce the dispersal distance of larvae compared to both passive models.

Settlement richness (the number of sites settled from each source region) was decreased when OHS or dvm was included in a model, but increased when OVM was included (F~7,144~ = 17.50, p \< 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A). The settlement diversity showed a similar effect of behaviour to richness, with OHS and DVM reducing diversity (F~7,144~ = 18.79, p \< 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). The variation of settlement diversity between regions was increased with OHS and DVM. the maximum connectance (% of all possible connections between regions) occurred when OVM behaviour was included, but all other behavioural combinations reduced the connectance of the models compared to no behaviour (@fig:settle-metrics C).

## Comparison of ontogenetic vertical migration scenarios

### Ontogenetic migration strategies

The overall effect of different ontogenetic vertical migration strategies (OVM) on the patterns of connectivity was smaller than the effect of implementing different behaviours (see Supplementary Figure S1). The effect of different strategies was strongly regional, with the southern sites (11-17) indistinguishable from one another, whereas regions 2 and 8 produced different patterns for each strategy (@fig:ovm-nmds-norm). Even when normalising the connectivity to the passive scenario, there was no effect of OVM strategies in explaining the dissimilarity (R^2^ < 0.001, p > 0.05). The differences between strategies also was not constant between regions, for example the OVM strategies Pomacentridae and Scorpaenidae were less dissimilar at region 6 and more dissimilar at region 2. The fish clustered around the direction of OVM (@fig:ovm-cap), separating Mullidae (larvae ontogenetically migrate upwards) to all the other downwards migrating strategies.

Comparing the total settlement of migration strategies, two clusters were identified. The first containing only Mullidae and the second containing all other models (@fig:cluster B). Within the former group, again sub-groupings were based on strategies, with one sub-group the strategies that migrated deepest with ontogeny (Serranidae and Scorpaenidae), an the other group the strategies which centred more in the 5-50 m layer (Labridae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, and Synodontidae). The differences in total settlement were driven by small regional changes, with the most notable effect of increased settlement at region 1 for the deep strategies (@fig:ovm-cca)

![Constrained correspondence analysis of the total settlement patterns to each region along NSW for each of the different models for the ontogenetic vertical migration strategies](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase2-cca.png){#fig:ovm-cca}

Changes in OVM strategies had significant effects on all the connectivity metrics; self-recruitment of larvae (F~6,96~ = 31.88, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics A), local retention (F~6,96~ = 40.90, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B), settlement success (F~6,96~ = 42.84, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C), and dispersal distance (F~6,96~ = 63.25, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The strategy of close to the surface during all stages of ontogeny, e.g. Mullidae, produced the lowest self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and the longest dispersal distance. Contrastingly, the strategy of migrating downwards with ontogeny below 50 m, most pronounced in Serranidae and Scorpaenidae,  increased self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and lowered the dispersal distances. Different OVM strategies did not produce any differences in richness (F~6,96~ = 1.11, p > 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A) or diversity (F~6,96~ = 0.79, p > 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). The strategies with the lowest connectance occurred with the Labridae and Scaridae strategies, while Synodontidae had the highest connectance values (@fig:settle-metrics C).

### Ontogenetic vertical migration methods

The method of ontogenetically migrating larvae within a model produced significantly different connectivity patterns  (R^2^ = 0.10; p < 0.01). Ontogenetically migrating larvae daily produced distinctly different patterns to stage and time step migration, where there was more overlap, especially in the southern regions (@fig:impl-nmds-norm). The central regions 6 and 8 seemed to produce the most dissimilar patterns between the three methods. The CAP analysis produced three seperate groupings for the methods, with daily and timestep the most dissimilar (@fig:impl-cap).

Comparisons of total settlement to regions found timestep to have the most dissimilar settlement patterns (@fig:cluster C). The differences were again driven by small regional differences, most notably an increased settlement at region 1 for stage and timestep compared to the daily migration model (@fig:impl-cca).

![Constrained correspondence analysis of the total settlement patterns to each region along NSW for each of the different implementation methods (stage-based, daily, and time-step) of ontogenetic vertical migration in the biophysical dispersal model](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase3-cca.png){#fig:impl-cca}

There were significant differences between self-recruitment (F~(2,32)~ = 5.68, p < 0.05), the daily method having lower self-recruitment than stage based migration (@fig:conn-metrics A). Time-step migration had the lowest mean local retention (F~(2,32)~ = 9.83, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B) and settlement success (F~(2,32)~ = 32.48, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C) between the OVM methods. The daily and time step methods both significantly dispersed further than the stage OVM method (F~(2,32)~ = 11.00, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The variation of dispersal distance for the daily OVM method had a standard deviation estimated to be 30% greater than the other methods. OVM methods did not have an effect on settlement site richness (F~(2,32)~ = 1.04, p \> 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A), there was an effect on diversity (F~(2,32)~ = 11.02, p < 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). This effect was caused by the OVM method of daily migration, which had lower settlement site diversity than the other OVM methods. However, the daily method of migration had the highest value of connectance (@fig:settle-metrics C).

### Overall context

The settlement patterns of behaviour were more dissimilar to each other than the OVM methods or strategies (@fig:all-cap). The behaviours with OHS and DVM were different to the behaviours including OVM or no behaviour. The variation between settlement patterns for OVM strategies and OVM methods were considerably smaller than those exhibited between the different behavioural choices. Although the dissimilarities between OVM methods were twice the dissimilarities measures seen between OVM strategies (@fig:cluster), they were at most 30% of the differences observed. The OVM method of migrating every time-step appeared to produce the same total settlement patterns as having no behaviour (@fig:all-cap). The model including DVM+OVM produced similar total settlement patterns to the Serranidae OVM strategy. The OVM strategies stretch across an axis from Mullidae (most in the surface) to Serranidae and Scorpaenidae (most in the 50-100 m waters).

The first two axis explain 36.0% of the inertia.](chapters/theoretical/figs/all-cap.png){#fig:all-cap}

Differences in behaviour were more influential in determining the settlement richness, diversity, and connectance between regions (@fig:settle-metrics). Diversity was impacted more by changes in OVM method than the strategy choice (@fig:settle-metrics B). Similar trends were seen in amongst the connectivity metrics, where different behaviours effected the metrics more than changes within OVM strategy or OVM methodology (@fig:conn-metrics). The one exception is dispersal distance, which also exhibited variation with both different OVM strategies and methodologies (@fig:conn-metrics D).

## Discussion

This study gives further insight into paradigm that larval fish have the ability to influence their dispersal patterns through vertical and horizontal swimming behaviours, predicting how these patterns are affected. In general, as predicted, giving larval fish swimming behaviour in the models (vertical, horizontal, or both) significantly changed the potential connectivity patterns. While the spawning location (and presumably timing, which was not a factor in our experiment) accounts for the majority of the variation between settlement patterns, swimming behaviour allows ichthyoplankton to settle closer to their natal region (increasing local retention), reduce the distance of dispersal (restricting the connectivity pathways), and increase their chances of settlement success. The strength of this behavioural effect on connectivity patterns is strongest with orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) and weakest with ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM). The influence of a particular swimming behaviour on the connectivity patterns is also dependent on the spawning locations, due to regional differences in hydrodynamics.

Orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) was the behaviour that changed the modelled connectivity patterns the most. OHS increased the local retention to the natal region, increasing self-recruitment and reducing the dispersal distance of the larvae. In addition, giving larvae the ability to sense, orientate, and swim towards a reef, sizeably increased their chances of settlement success. These results are in agreement with modelling studies in other regions, that have shown OHS to increase the local retention and self-recruitment of larval fish at similar levels [@wolanski2014a] and to increase the settlement success and reduce the dispersal distance [@staaterman2012] - noting the method of OHS utilised in this study was closer to the method implemented by @staaterman2012 than @wolanski2014a, which increased the swimming potential with ontogeny. These results predict that ichthyoplankton, which can sense and orientate towards a reef, both increase their settlement success significantly and gives them an ability to directly influence their dispersal trajectory. The effect of OHS on the connectivity was so pronounced that restricting the larvae to the surface or advecting them using the vertical component of the velocity made almost no difference, and subsequent additions of vertical behavioural traits only marginally modified the connectivity patterns. The influence of OHS on connectivity patterns relative to DVM and OVM could be due to the larvae making an informed decision (sensing a reef and orientating towards it), rather than migrating without any information as to the benefit of that decision. Another explanation is that the method of OHS used is unrepresentative of *in situ* behaviour and overemphasised to ability of fish to orientate and swim horizontally towards reefs. One limitation of this approach was giving all larvae the strong sense to orientate towards the closest reef, removing any natural occurring variation in orientation abilities of individuals [@leis2014].

Surprisingly, ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) did not have an effect on local retention, only increasing the self-recruitment of a region and no effect on settlement success. Previous studies have found OVM to noticeably increase local retention and change the resultant connectivity patterns compared to non-swimming (passive) larvae [@paris2007a; @butler2011], and also increasing settlement success [@aiken2011]. Vertically migrating with ontogeny is considered a strong retention mechanism [@paris2004a], yet in this study the evidence for retention was weak. This suggests that the effect size of OVM on larval retention is dependent on the regional hydrodynamics. Spawning location and timing are known to have a stronger effect on the connectivity patterns compared to vertical migration behaviours [@puckett2014]. The hydrodynamics of the region used in this study are dominated by a poleward nearshore boundary current (the East Australia Current) that separates off the coast around regions 7 and 8, generating mesoscale eddies that influence larval dispersal [@suthers2011]. However, OVM did moderately increase the settlement success and lower the dispersal distance of the larvae. Diel vertical migration (DVM) had a stronger effect on the connectivity patterns and connectivity metrics than OVM (where OVM used the stage based method described above), suggesting the frequency of vertical migration influences local retention. Non-swimming larvae that were moved by a vertical component (passive), had connectivity patterns that were more similar to models with OVM, than the non-swimming larvae restricted to the surface waters (passive-surface). This suggest that the vertical component most likely advected larvae downwards at a slow rate, mimicking the stage based ontogenetic vertical migration used.

The hypothesis that the strategy of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) would influence the patterns and metrics of dispersal was partially supported, as while there was an effect of different strategies, it was minuscule. The largest differences were seen between the direction of the strategies (upward or downward migration with ontogeny), creating the trade-off where upward migration increases the dispersal distance and downward migration increases local retention. This result partially correlates with similar observations, where migrating to deeper depths has been shown to reduce transport [@huebert2011], except where this study did not find differences between migrating to the middle (5-50 m) or deep (50-100 m) layers. This suggests that the choice of vertical migration strategy, while having a small effect on dispersal, is most likely driven by other factors such as predator avoidance or, choice of prey or growth strategies [@lampert1989]. These results suggest that using generalised OVM data for modelling a specific species might not effect the connectivity patterns much, as long as the direction of migration is accurately defined, helped by the fact most species are known to migrate downwards [@cowen2002].

The method of OVM produced significant differences in the patterns of dispersal, between the two extremes of fast movement (time step) and slow movement (stage), and the daily migration method, contrary to our hypothesis of minimal differences. In similar results, different speeds of vertical migration have been shown to alter the direction and distance of dispersal [@sundelof2012]. It is unclear why daily migration is more different to migrating every time step than migrating with change of ontogenetic stage, as it is a faster vertical migration method. Interestingly, differences in the speed (method) of vertical migration were greater than differences in distribution (strategy). Therefore careful consideration must be made when adding ontogenetic vertical migration to a BDM, as choice of method of vertical migration has the potential to influence the connectivity more than the given distribution. There is also an argument to include different strategies to account for the individual variation seen in larval fish [@nanninga2014].

When considering a biophysical dispersal model to measure connectivity of ichthyoplankton, this study suggests that the modelling choice of swimming behaviours (vertical and horizontal) to include is a more important decision on the connectivity patterns than the actual parameterisation or method of implementation of the behaviour. Therefore more emphasises should be placed on what behaviours are specific to a species, and then general values can be utilised when no specific values are available in the literature. Considering the differences between passive larvae (restricted and unrestricted) and larvae that vertically migrate with ontogeny, when modelling a species or taxa with limited empirical data about their vertical distribution, advecting the larvae using the vertical component of the hydrodynamic velocities can produce similar connectivity patterns as including OVM. These results also highlight the importance of the process of the behaviour, modellers choice, however arbitrary, can effect the patterns of connectivity. More robust knowledge than we currently have on the process behind these behaviours (e.g. speed of vertical migration, settlement detecting distance, or development of senses) are fundamental to producing more accurate and precise connectivity patterns.

The strong effect of OHS raises the need for more empirical studies on the ability of different taxa to sense settlement habitat, the frequency at which they orientate towards sensed habitat and the sustained speeds at which the larvae swim towards the sensed habitat. In this BDM study, each settlement reef was considered to be equally attractive to the larval fish. This is unrealistic, as it has been demonstrated that reef fish can sense natal reefs [@bottesch2016] and can most likely discriminate between other sensed reefs. The settlement sensory distance was also kept constant for all larvae, which again doesn't reflect the individual variation of sensory abilities for larvae and does not capture how settlement cues could be affected by hydrodynamics (i.e. odour; @gerlach2007a), location of sun (i.e. sight; @berenshtein2014a), or environmental variables such as temperature and salinity (i.e. sound; @sallares2009) . While out of scope for this study, further modelling studies should follow suggestions by @staaterman2014 and investigate the effect of different sensory abilities and their environmental cues on connectivity patterns.

## Conclusion

In summary, this study emphasises the importance of giving ichthyoplankton in biophysical dispersal models the ability to horizontally or vertically migrate, and not only passively advecting them by currents with a neutral buoyancy. Orientated horizontal swimming appears to be especially influential on potential connectivity patterns. The caveat to including migration behaviour is that there needs to be empirical data underlying its inclusion in the model. However, this study shows that for ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), in a region influenced by a boundary current, general taxa specific data might not give patterns much different to species-specific data. Instead of focusing on the distributional patterns for OVM , more thought and research is required on the processes of OVM (e.g. fast or slow), as it is shown to affect the connectivity patterns more.
