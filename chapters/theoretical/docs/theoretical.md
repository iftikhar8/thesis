Comparing the influence of the implementation of different larval behavioural strategies on connectivity patterns in biophysical dispersal models
=================================================================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

Recent empirical studies have demonstrated how pelagic larval fish, far from being passive as previously thought, can exhibit a variety of behaviours to influence where they settle [@leis2006]. The swimming behaviours of larval fish that are able to influence the dispersal paths are vertical migration—ontogenetic [@paris2004a] and diel [@huebert2011]—and orientated horizontal swimming [towards preferred settlement habitat @gerlach2007a]. These behaviours allow ichthyoplankton to remain closer to the natal reef, by avoiding strong wind-driven surface currents advecting them away, and by swimming in the direction of identifiable reef using cues (e.g. their natal reef). However, understanding the effect of these migration behaviours on the entire connectivity across a region is difficult to do empirically [@cowen2009]. Connectivity itself is a challenging problem to empirically study, even with recent advancements in empirical techniques [@jones2005; @williamson2016; @gillanders2002]. Understanding the early life history of ichthyoplankton and it influences dispersal *in situ* is an even greater challenge due to the size of larvae and the expansive nature of the marine environment. Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM), using coupled complex physical (hydrodynamics) and biological (larval behaviour) models, becomes a useful tool to infer the influence of process on marine larval dispersal [@werner2007].

As the understanding of ichthyoplankton behavioural abilities during their early-life history develops, how these behaviours influence their dispersal becomes an important question. Modelling studies have implemented different migration behaviours; ontogenetic vertical migration [OVM; @paris2007a], diel vertical migration [DVM; @aiken2011], and orientated horizontal swimming [OHS; @staaterman2012], and found that all influence connectivity patterns by reducing dispersal distance and increasing local retention. The problem for modellers and empirical researchers is to decide where to focus both the models (i.e. what behaviours are most important to include) and empirical research (i.e. what data should we be focused on collecting to parameterise these models). Even when there is consensus on the importance of a specific behaviour on connectivity, i.e. OVM, there is often only empirical data for a few species available in the literature [@leis2006]. OVM has been included in many modelling studies [@holstein2014; @donahue2015; @rochette2012], yet the specific values for a species or taxa of ichthyoplankton are often unavailable in the literature. Modellers are forced to choose between limiting the behaviour [@andrello2013], using generalisations or substitute species [@young2012], or parameterising the model with generic larval traits and not a particular species or taxa [@corell2012].

The other decision modellers are required to make is how to model the processes that drive the behaviour. Due to the difficulty of obtaining field data, this information is often unknown, leading to assumptions, e.g. how do larvae vertically migrate with ontogeny - is it a slow or fast process, or when larvae are getting advected by offshore currents - do they swim at a speeds similar to those observed in flow chambers [@fisher2000] or are they better approximated by *in situ* speeds measured close to settlement reefs [@leis1997]. The exact mechanisms behind this movement with ontogeny are less well understood [@irisson2010], leading to different methods of implementing the underlying processes seen amongst BDMs [@garcia-garcia2016; @puckett2014; @paris2007a]

BDM studies provide us a mechanism to model the complex behaviour of larval fish and understand how different behavioural characteristics influence dispersal patterns, with the intention of increasing the accuracy and precision of the modelled patterns. Currently there is no consensus on the importance of behaviours to include within model, and it is difficult to compare across studies due to the large number of variables (see Chapter 2). Often the limiting factor to including behaviour is the requirement to make assumptions due to unknown effect of behavioural traits of specific species of interest, and limited knowledge of the underlying processes for the behaviour.

The aim of this study is to provide an integrated assessment of the relative importance of the inclusion of various larval behavioural processes on connectivity patterns in BDMs, specifically the use of OVM, DVM, and OHS. Given the perceived importance of OVM (as described above) and the relative lack of empirical data for parameterisation, I also compare different OVM implementation methodologies and parametrisation strategies based on data from Chapter 3. I expect that all behaviours (and combinations of) will influence the connectivity patterns and resulting metrics, compared to no swimming behaviour. Further, its predicted that vertical migration (OVM and DVM) will have a stronger effect than OHS. For the second aim, I expect that the patterns of migration and not the underlying process should be the main influence of connectivity patterns.

### Model development

The biophysical dispersal model—Zooplankton Interconnections and Source-Sink Observation Utility [ZISSOU, v1.1.4; @hawes2018]—is an individual-based model (IBM) developed in accordance with recommendations from the “Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life” [@north2009]. The major processes captured by ZISSOU are described in the flow chart shown in @fig:flowchart. Movement of particles within the model is forced by offline oceanographic current data but can be influenced by larval behavioural traits parameterised using probability distributions capturing known biological variability. The system was designed for high-performance, high customisation, and platform independence; written in the language Scala (v2.12.4; http://www.scala-lang.org) using parallel libraries for scalability.

The move process encapsulates all migration; DVM = diel vertical migration, OHS = orientated horizontal swimming, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration.](chapters/theoretical/figs/ZISSOU-workflow.png){#fig:flowchart}

#### Physical sub-model

ZISSOU accesses ocean circulation or hydrodynamic data as network common data forms (NetCDF); self-describing, machine-independent data formats. The data can be accessed either using locally stored files or using the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP; http://www.opendap.org). This project took advantage of Java NetCDF software libraries developed by UCAR/Unidata (http://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6). The ocean data must be in an Arakawa-A or Arakawa-B grid structure [@arakawa1997]. Currently ZISSOU utilises the 3-dimensional velocity fields of hydrodynamic models only, with environmental variables such as salinity or temperature to be incorporated into future versions.

Runge-Kutta fourth-order integration (RK4) is the ordinary differential equations solver used to move the particle through space and time [@north2009], calculating a weighted average over four increments using the chosen model time step (@eq:rk4). The velocity at any given position in space is interpolated using a tri-cubic interpolation scheme on the hydrodynamic model grid, such that the velocity for a given particle in the oceanographic space is interpolated from neighbouring grids using 64 points (4^3^; @eq:interpolation). If this is not possible, for example due to boundary conditions, trilinear interpolation using 8 points (2^3^) is substituted.

$$ f(x,y,z) = \sum_{i=0}^3 \sum_{j=0}^3 \sum_{k=0}^3 v_{ijk} x^i y^j z^k $${#eq:interpolation}

where the velocity *v* at the point *(x,y,z)*; *x* is the longitude, *y* is the latitude, and *z* is the depth; is interpolated using the 64 nearest neighbours.

$$\overrightarrow{ v_{t+h} } = \overrightarrow{v_t} + \frac{(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\Delta{t}}{6}$${#eq:rk4}

$$k_1 = f(x_t, y_t, z_t)$$

$$k_2 = k_1 + f\left(x_{\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right)}, y_{\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right)}, z_{\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right)}\right)$$

$$k_3 = k_2 + f\left(x_\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right), y_\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right), z_\left(t + \frac{\Delta{t}}{2}\right)\right)$$

$$k_4 = k_3 + f(x_{(t + \Delta{t})}, y_{(t + \Delta{t})}, z_{(t + \Delta{t})})$$

where the integrated velocity vector (*v~t+∆t~*), at time *t* and time step *∆t* is calculated using the weighted average of the four separate interpolations (*k~1~, k~2~, k~3~, k~4~*). The velocities are interpolated at the current time, two midpoint approximations of the time with half the time step added, and at the time incremented by the time step. The tri-cubic interpolation function *f(x,y,z)* calculates the velocities as described above (@eq:interpolation).

To model the natural turbulent effect of ocean systems in a 3D stochastic model, ZISSOU uses a random displacement mechanism [@eq:turb; @brickman2002; @north2009].

$$D = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{\Delta{t}} \mathbb Z}$${#eq:turb}

where *D* is the displacement for a given direction, *K* is the eddy diffusivity parameter, the model time step *∆t* and a random number *Z* from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero. The displacement is added to the velocity for the specified direction (u, v or w) at each time step.

Psuedo-random numbers are generated in the model using a Mersenne Twister algorithm, WELL44497b [@panneton2006]. The seed for the random number generator is an optional parameter of the model to allow for exact reproducibility of results if needed.

#### Biological sub-model

Biological traits are specified using a configurable XML file as input to the model. The biological model implements many biological processes that are considered to be important for marine larval dispersal (@tbl:bio-params). The pelagic larval duration is specified by the length of the larval period in days. Larvae can be assigned a non-settlement competency period, whereby they cannot settle before a specified number of days, otherwise they attempt to settle upon reaching their PLD. Spawning sites are given as GPS locations (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees), with spawning time and frequency, the spawning depth in the water column, and the number of larvae to spawn as options which can be tailored to the modelled marine species. The particles seeded in the model are referred to as larvae, but can also simulate pelagic eggs through the inclusion of a specific age stage. The ichthyoplankton developmental stages (hatching, preflexion, flexion, postflexion) are based on a description of the mean (± standard deviation) age (in days) of larvae of each stage. From this input, stage transition ages (day at which the larvae transitions from one developmental stage to another) are assigned to individual larvae at birth using a Gaussian distribution (if no standard deviation is specified, the mean is the value).

Settlement sites are represented as GIS polygons within the model, using point in polygon algorithms to determine if larvae are over settlement sites. The polygons are supplied as input in the Shapefile format, a common geospatial vector data format specified by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri; https://www.esri.com/). Larval mortality can be included in the model, specified as a percentage daily rate of mortality applied randomly across the population, a common approach amongst connectivity studies [@butler2011; @kool2011; @treml2015].

Vertical migration can be implemented as either diel or ontogenetic vertical migration. Both are based on the probability of being in a specific depth range based on either the time of day (i.e. night or day), or their ontogenetic stage (@fig:ovm-example). The vertical position of a larvae was changed by applying a probability distribution function to determine to which depth the larvae moved. For diel vertical migration this probability distribution function was applied one hour before sunset or sunrise using an approximation calculated using the current latitude / longitude of the larvae.

There are three choices for the timing of ontogenetic vertical migration using different methodologies; vertically migrating when the next developmental stage is reached, at the end of a 24 hour period (daily migration), or during each time step within chosen constraints of movement. Moving larvae vertically with the onset of ontogenetic stage is the simplest methods and has been used in many studies [@garcia-garcia2016], but creates a completely stratified larval distribution (all members of a stage class are at the same depth). Another approach, which doesn't lead to this strict, and perhaps biologically unrealistic stage distribution pattern is to allow some amount of vertical migration every day or time step but with  migration restricted to certain depth ranges based on ontogeny. This strategy has been used in many studies [@puckett2014; @paris2007a] and creates a more random process with a centre of mass at specific depths. In essence, these strategies allow for modelling vertical behaviour whereby different species of ichthyoplankton change vertical position restricted or unrestricted by depth.

![Example of ontogenetic vertical migration input for a fish than migrates downwards with ontogeny, where the proportions of larval occurrence at different depths are specified for each stage (preflexion, flexion, and postflexion), and must sum to one for each developmental stage](chapters/theoretical/figs/ovm-example.png){#fig:ovm-example}

A settlement buffer can be specified that enables the larvae to discover settlement habitat if they pass within the prescribed distance. The distance is measured as the nearest point on the habitat polygon. If multiple polygons are detected within the distance, the closest habitat polygon to the larvae is settled. The settlement buffer implements the idea of "sticky waters" close to reefs [@andutta2012], compensation for factors not captured in the model such as unresolved habitats and behaviours that help propel larvae towards settlement habitat.

The sensory distance allows larvae to "sense" settlement habitat if they pass within a specified distance, acting as pseudo-behaviour for cues such as vision, hearing or olfaction . The distance is specified in kilometres (km), as reef fish larvae have been shown to smell reefs from distances of several kilometres [@paris2013b]. Larvae can be given a horizontal swimming speed (@eq:swim), whereby when settlement habitat is "sensed" the larvae can orientate ad swim in the sensed direction, while also getting advected by the oceanographic currents (@eq:u; @eq:v).

The sensory distance allows larvae to "sense" settlement habitat if they pass within a specified distance, acting as pseudo-behaviour for cues such as vision, hearing or olfaction [@leis2006; @kingsford2002]. Some species of larval fish have the ability to smell reefs from distances of several kilometres [@paris2013b]. Once within the sensory distance of viable habitat, larvae are able to swim towards the reef. While there are numerous measures of larval swimming capacity developed in the literature—U~crit~, maximum speed, endurance, *in-situ* speed—there is little consensus on which is most appropriate to use within a modelling context. The approach I take here assumes the larvae swim at a rate somewhere between *in-situ* speed and U~crit~ but not continuously. Specifically the horizontal swimming speed in the model is calculated using U~crit~ as the maximum sustained swimming speed and using the *in-situ* speed as the minimum sustained swimming speed, with a random number generator giving a speed between the two for each time step (@eq:swim). The critical swimming speed [U~crit~, @brett1964], is a standard measure of swimming potential of larval fish and is commonly available for many reef fish species and easy to measure [@hogan2007]. The *in situ* swimming speed is a measure of larval fish swimming ability in the ocean (as measured by divers) and correlates with U~crit~ [@leis2006a]. I also assume the fish cannot swim for the entire duration of the time step, the duration the fish can swim is specified using a parameter of endurance potential (@eq:swim). The direction of movement is calculated using the orientation of the sensed reef (@eq:u; @eq:v).


Specifically, the horizontal swimming speed is calculated using U~crit~, the critical swimming speed (ms^-1^), which is a measure of the swimming capacity of the larvae and useful as it is not difficult to obtain [@hogan2007]. *X* is a random number with a distribution constrained by a minimum *s~p~*, the *in situ* swimming potential expressed as a proportion of *U~crit~*), and a maximum value of 1. The *in situ* . The endurance potential *E~p~* is the proportion of time step it is expected to swim of the fish larvae, acting as a measure of how long the larvae can swim without tiring.

$$s_{fish} = U_{crit} \mathbb Z_{[s_p,1]} E_p$${#eq:swim}

$$u^{\prime} = u + s_{fish} \cos \theta $${#eq:u}

$$v^{\prime} = v + s_{fish} \sin \theta $${#eq:v}

where *s~fish~* is the horizontal swimming speed *s~fish~*, *U~crit~* is the cricitcal swimmign speed, *Z* is a a random number with a minimum value of the *in situ* swimming potential *s_p* and maximum value of 1, and *E_p* is the endurance potential. *u* is the longitude vector, *v* is the latitude vector, and *θ* is the angle of orientation towards the sensed reef.

### Model configuration

#### Study location

The New South Wales (NSW) coastline (2,137 km) was divided into approximately 17 equally sized regions of approximately 125 km each (@fig:release-sites). Rocky reef patches were identified using benthic data obtained from NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH; http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au). Within each sub-region, four rocky reef patches (approximately 30 hectares in size) from across the sub-region were chosen as spawning sites. Larvae were released weekly from the centre of each spawning site in batches of 1000 over the period July 2007 to June 2008. In total 3.5 million larvae were released. Larvae were allowed to settle to the identified rocky reef patches or benthic habitat patches which had been categorised as "unknown": unmapped patches could be potential rocky reef settlement sites.

#### Physical sub-model

The oceanographic circulation model used was BRAN3 [Bluelink renalysis, version 3p5; @oke2013], a hindcast model based on the Ocean Forecasting Australia Model (OFAM). BRAN is a data-assimilating model that aims to resolve mesoscale eddies in 3-dimensions, at the scale of 10 km in the horizontal (0.1° latitude and longitude) and 5-10 m vertically (15 depth bins between 0 and 105 m). The model output consists of mean daily current velocities, sea-level anomaly, sea-surface temperature, and salinity over the period January 1993 to September 2012. An eddy diffusivity value (*K*) of 300 ms^-1^ was used, as per similar studies in the region [@condie2016; @chiswell2011]. The time step of the model was two hours.

#### Biological sub-model

Model parameters are based on characteristics of a temperate rock reef fish from the family Pomacentridae (Damselfishes). We chose this group as it is relatively well studied, thus providing reasonable estimates of the various parameters required for modelling. The literature on fish early-life histories is biased towards tropical and sub-tropical species, therefore where values for temperate Pomacentridae were not found, information of tropical larvae was utilised (@tbl:bio-params). An individual larvae only settled at the end of their pelagic larval duration if it was within the settlement buffer distance of suitable settlement habitat. The larvae were spawned in the preflexion stage, assuming a species with benthic eggs which is common for Pomacentridae. The lack of velocity data near the coast is an inherent property of the grid structure of the flow model but one that can limit the ability of fish to settle on some reef patches. In order to compensate for this as well as the coarse 10 km resolution of the oceanographic model, larvae were given a settlement buffer of 10 km, which was slightly larger (but within one standard deviation) of the mean settlement buffer distance of 8.3 km (± 5.2) identified in the review of existing studies presented in Chapter 2 (@tbl:bio-base). Note however for the simulations described in this chapter, no mortality was applied due to the aim of comparing patterns of potential connectivity and not realised connectivity.

In order to address the first aim of evaluating the influence of different behaviours on connectivity patterns I ran a series of models to compare patterns resulting from the implementation of 1) with or without vertical advection (VA) by currents, 2) diel vertical migration (DVM), 2) ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and 3) orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) implemented. Each behaviour (and combination of congruent behaviours) was compared to a base case of passive restricted transport where the larvae are only allowed to change their horizontal position (scenario 1; .

In order to address the first aim of evaluating the influence of different behaviours on connectivity patterns I ran a series of models with different combinations of the behaviours to compare patterns resulting from the implementation of (1) vertical advection (VA), (2) diel vertical migration (DVM), (3) ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and (4) orientated horizontal swimming (OHS). Each behaviour (and combination of congruent behaviours) was compared to a base case of passive, vertically-restricted (no movement in horizontal direction, either passive or active) transport (scenario 1, @tbl:models-behaviour).

Mechanisms are abbreviated as: VA = vertical advection, DVM = diel vertical migration, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration, and OHS = orientated horizontal swimming. {#tbl:models-behaviour}

The vertical advection scenarios are included as implementation of this in existing models is varied and has the potential to impact connectivity in a manner similar to the behaviourally driven vertical movement. This mechanism only applies to models with no other vertical migration component, as DVM and OVM change the vertical position of the larvae after it has been advected by the *w* (vertical) vector (@tbl:models-behaviour). Larvae were given the DVM probabilities for Pomacentridae derived from an ichthyoplankton study in the same oceanic region [@gray1998]. Larvae were migrated using a probability distribution function between 25 m depth bins within the top 100 m of the water column (@fig:dvm).

![The diel vertical distribution patterns used in the model for the day and night time.](chapters/theoretical/figs/diel-example.png){#fig:dvm}

The OVM models used the values for OVM distribution values of Pomacentridae larvae observed in the empirical study described in Chapter 3 (see Appendix B). This data indicated that the larvae centre of mass moves downwards from the surface during preflexion, to commonly the top 50 m during postflexion (@fig:models-ovm).

For the OHS scenario, to orientate and swim towards a reef, the larval fish were given an reef sensory distance of 10 km, which was the maximum extent used in other studies [@wolanski2014a; @staaterman2012; @tbl:orientate]. The swimming ability of the larvae was based on the a common tropical Pomacentridae species *Abudefduf vaigensis*. Tropical species are strongly represented in studies of larval fish swimming speeds and therefore more data is available. They are predicted to swim faster than temperate species due to hydrodynamic differences in temperature [@herbing2002] and viscosity [@fuiman1997], however, this study is only comparing the effect of including swimming behaviour and not predicting realistic patterns of connectivity for the region. Each larval fish was was given a critical swimming speed (U~crit~) of 0.463 ms^-1^ and an *in situ* potential of 25%, values observed for *A. vaigensis* [@leis2006a], therefore the actual swimming speed ranged between 0.116 to 0.463 ms^-1^. Pomacentridae larval fish are competent swimmers, having been seen to sustain constant speeds on average for 50 hours and with a maximum effort of more than 230 hours in laboratory settings [@stobutzki1997]. In this study I used a conservative estimate of endurance, only allowing the larval fish to swim for 50% of each time step (one hour). Similar to a metric of *FV~50~* (50% fatigue velocity) used in other studies to measure the sustained speed over a 1-2 hour period [@jenkins2002] and its reasonable to believe this speed is less than U~crit~ [@leis2006].

The second aim, to assess the impact on connectivity of using different ontogenetic vertical migration parameters was addressed by conducting model runs using proportional depth stage abundance profiles which represented the seven fish families studied in Chapter 3 (@fig:models-ovm; for the actual values see Appendix B). Ontogenetic vertical migration was implemented such that the larvae moved when they reached their next ontogenetic stage (based on developmental time).

Lastly, in order to explore the impact of the OVM implementation strategy on connectivity patterns I compared three different methods of ontogenetic vertical migration; time step, daily and ontogenetic stage migration (@tbl:models-impl). The vertical position of the larvae are changed using a probability distribution function at the different times in the model iterations (1) time step, (2) after 24 hours in the model, and (3) when the larvae change ontogenetic stage. Settlement stage Pomacentridae larvae of *Chromis atripectoralis* have been seen to change 15 m in vertical position within six minutes [@leis2004], but the behaviour of less developed larval fish is unknown. Therefore for the migration method in (1), due to the higher frequency of positional change, larvae are restricted to moving only 25 m or less.

### Data analysis

Each individual model run produced as output a connectivity matrix, which represents the connectivity between larval source (row *i*) and settlement (column *j*) regions where each element *i,j* is the proportion of all larvae spawned at *i* which settled at *j* over the release period. There are two important questions of connectivity patterns, where do the larvae settle and where do the settlement larvae come from. Therefore, the connectivity patterns from a source region and to a settlement region were both investigated. Multivariate comparisons of the connectivity patterns from source regions were made using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) which allowed for the assessment of the relative similarity of regional patterns (replicates) across different model scenarios (variables). I used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures to get distance matrices and applied a square root transform to down-weight the influence of highly abundant areas of settlement. There were strong differences in settlement patterns of the source regions due to variations in regional oceanography (see Results). These differences are interesting but can serve to swamp the more pertinent comparisons between models. In order to capture these differences between models more explicitly, the regional noise in the connectivity patterns was reduced by normalising the raw settlement proportions by the settlement values of the passive model with no VA.

Distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test for the significance of the normalised multivariate source region settlement patterns for each model within a scenario (behavioural, OVM strategy, and OVM method). PERMANOVA, using the models and regions as fixed factors, tested the hypothesis that settlement patterns were different for each region and scenario. Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP)—constrained coordinates analysis allowing for non-Euclidean distances—was used to compare the dissimilarity between models within each scenario, reducing all the source region settlement patterns to a single point for comparison [@anderson2003]. Significance tests of the CAP ordination, the ordination axes, and variable addition and deletion (Type I and Type III tests respectively) were performed. The connectivity patterns of settlement regions were measured using the total settlement at that region. To compare the patterns of settlement regions from models within each scenario, hierarchal cluster analysis (using an average-link clustering method with a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure) constrained coordinates analysis (CCA; using Euclidean distance metrics) were conducted.

Several univariate measures were extracted from each connectivity matrix: settlement site richness (the number of reefs receiving settlers), Shannon-Weiner diversity of settlement (using number of reefs and total larvae settled per reef), self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, dispersal distance (refer to Chapter 2, @tbl:definitions for definitions), and connectance (the proportion of the edges connecting natal and settlement sites in a graph compared to the theoretical maximum number of edges). Differences between model scenarios were assessed by comparing each metric amongst different sets of matrices (depending on the aim) with regions (n = 17) as replicates in one-way repeated measure ANOVAs, to account for the regional oceanographic variation in each model. Tukey post-hoc pairwise tests were used to assess differences amongst regions where ANOVAs were significant (α = 0.05).

All data analysis was performed using the R statistical programming environment [v3.4.3; @rcoreteam2017]. Some additional packages were used for analysis; *ConnMattTools* [@kaplan2017] to obtain connectivity metrics, *igraph* [@csardi2006] and *NetIndices* [@kones2009] to construct the graphs and obtaining measures of connectance, and *vegan* to calculate dissimilarity matrices, NMDS, PERMANOVA (using the *adonis* function), and CAP analysis [@oksanen2018].

### Behaviour scenario: comparison of the different behavioural models

#### Connectivity from source regions

There were strong differences in source region connectivity patterns which displayed a strong geographical gradient across all behaviours, creating a "horseshoe" shape on the NMDS where regions were most similar with geographically similar regions (@fig:nmds-behaviour). For 59% of the source regions (1-4, 9-10, 14-17), there were two distinct clusters of settlement patterns; driven by the inclusion of orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) behaviour in the model (@fig:nmds-behaviour). Region 9 showed the strongest differences between settlement patterns with or without OHS. An interesting result was the settlement patterns of region 16 with OHS were more similar to the settlement patterns of region 17 without OHS, than region 16 without OHS. For the other 41% of source regions, the settlement patterns were grouped based on region and not behaviour.

Standardising the settlement patterns by the passive model in multivariate space reduces the passive model to a single point (@fig:nmds-behaviour-std), therefore the size of the effect of behaviour is measured by the distance from this centering point of passive connectivity. When standardised by the settlement patterns from the passive model, the strong clustering of OHS behaviours seen in @fig:nmds-behaviour becomes less distinct (@fig:nmds-behaviour-std). The effect of models with OHS is considerably stronger than models without OHS, with the models OVM and OVM+DVM showing little differentiation for most regions (@fig:nmds-behaviour-std). Interestingly for all the behavioural models, the settlement from sources regions 11-13 were similar to the passive model. The effects of source region are strongest for the models with OHS included. For some source regions the models with OHS still clustered strongly (e.g. 3, 8, and 9), but for other regions there were considerable dissimilarities between models with OHS (e.g 1, 5, and 6). The model with diel vertical migration (DVM) showed the most unique settlement patterns, with little overlap from other models. PERMANOVA found no differences between the standardised settlement patterns from the sources regions for the different behavioural models (R^2^ = 0.03, p > 0.05), instead regional patterns explained most of the variation (R^2^ = 0.60, p < 0.001).

The CAP analysis indicated including behaviour in a model, and different combinations of behaviour, changed the connectivity patterns of the larvae (@fig:cap-behaviour; F~(9,144)~ = 1.35; p = 0.031). The settlement patterns formed two clusters, models with OHS included and models without. The grouping of models without was not as tightly clustered as the grouping of models with OHS. Of the models without OHS, models with DVM migration were less similar than models with OVM to the passive model. The passive model with vertical advection was more similar to the model with OVM than the passive model alone. The most dissimilar models were the passive and the model with all three behaviours (DVM+OVM+OHS). Restricting the larvae to the surface (Passive) or allowing the particle to be advected vertically (Passive+VA) produced dissimilar connectivity patterns, but when combined with OHS the connectivity patterns were identical.

#### Connectivity to settlement regions

Comparing the connectivity of the behavioural models to settlement region, cluster analysis of the settlement regions by behavioural models produced two distinct clusters; models with and without OHS (@fig:settlement-behaviour A). Within the OHS cluster, models without vertical migration behaviour (regardless of the use of vertical advection) were highly similar. In the non-OHS cluster, the most dissimilar model was DVM. Across both clusters, models with OVM were more similar than models with DVM. In the non-OHS cluster, the passive models and the OVM models grouped together (@fig:settlement-behaviour A). The settlement patterns of the models OHS and OHS with VA were homologous, in contrast to the dissimilarity of the settlement patterns from the passive and passive with VA models.

Comparisons of the connectivity to settlement regions using CCA analysis also produced two clusters, similar to the CAP analysis on the entire connectivity matrix (@fig:settlement-behaviour B; @fig:cap-behaviour). However, the dissimilarity between models within a cluster displayed opposite patterns, whereby using total settlement the OHS models were less similar than the non-OHS models (excluding DVM). The models with OHS are more dissimilar to each other using total settlement as compared to the analysis using regional settlement patterns. The variation between behaviour scenario models was explained by a combination of settlement regions (@fig:settlement-behaviour B). OHS models had increased settlement at regions 1, 2 ,3, and 16 and decreased settlement at the regions 5, 6, and 10.

#### Connectivity metrics

Including behaviour in models increased self-recruitment to a region, compared to passive larvae (F~9,144~ = 12.31, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics A). The OVM model was an exception, unless OVM behaviour was used in combination with another behaviour. The DVM and DVM+OHS models had the highest self-recruitment and the lowest variation across regions. The lowest self-recruitment occurred in the passive model with no VA. Similarly, local retention increased when including behaviours except OVM unless coupled with OHS (F~9,144~ = 79.24, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B). In particular, including OHS in a model approximately doubled the local retention to a region. Larvae that were passive with no vertical restriction or exhibited OVM behaviour had consistently lower local retention values. Including DVM gave rise to the most variation of local retention between regions. Considering the metric of settlement success the effect of OHS was evident, increasing the chances of settlement success by ~30% (F~9,144~ = 95.02, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C). The models OVM, DVM, and DVM+OVM did not change the settlement success compared to passive larvae. Variation in settlement success between regions was greatest when passive larvae were only horizontally advected. OHS behaviour significantly reduced the dispersal distance by ~40% when compared to passive larvae, and also reducing the variation by ~75% (F~9,144~ = 66.33, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The OVM model did not significantly reduce the dispersal distance of larvae compared to the passive models.

Settlement richness was decreased when OHS or DVM behaviour was in a model, but increased with OVM behaviour (F~7,144~ = 17.50, p \< 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A). The settlement diversity showed a similar effect as behaviour on richness, with OHS and DVM reducing diversity (F~7,144~ = 18.79, p \< 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). The variation of settlement diversity between regions was increased with OHS and DVM. Connectance was highest for the models with only OVM behaviour or the passive models, and lowest for models with OHS behaviours (@fig:settle-metrics C). DVM behaviour was observed to reduce the connectance between regions.

Comparison of ontogenetic vertical migration scenarios
------------------------------------------------------

### Ontogenetic migration strategies

The effect (difference from base case) of different strategies was strongly regional, with the northern (1-5), central (6-10), and southern sites (11-17) clustering together (@fig:nmds-ovm-std). The variation described by OVM strategies using the standardised connectivity patterns from source regions was negligible (R^2^ < 0.01, p > 0.05) compared to the variation between regions (R^2^ = 0.95, p = 0.005). The differences between strategies also was not constant across regions, e.g. the OVM strategies Pomacentridae and Scorpaenidae were more similar at region 6 than region 2.

The CAP analysis showed groupings between strategies of vertical migration upwards with ontogeny (Mullidae) and migrations downwards with ontogeny (the other 6 strategies; @fig:cap-ovm). However, the groupings were not significantly different to each other (F~(6,96)~ = 0.95, p > 0.05), likely due to the strong regional differences described above. Scaridae and Pomacentridae had the closest connectivity patterns between the OVM strategies.

Two clusters were identified when comparing the total settlement of the different migration strategies. The first cluster contained only the Mullidae strategy, and the second comprised all the other OVM strategies (@fig:settlement-ovm A). Within the latter group the sub-groupings were based on strategies, with one sub-group consisting of the strategies that migrated deepest with increasing ontogeny (Serranidae and Scorpaenidae), and the other group containing OVM strategies with centres of mass in the 5-50 m depth layer at postflexion (Labridae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, and Synodontidae). The differences in total settlement were driven by small regional changes, with the most notable effect of increased settlement at region 1 for the OVM strategies that migrated deeper with ontogeny (@fig:settlement-ovm B)

Differences in OVM strategy affected each of the reported connectivity metrics; self-recruitment (F~(6,96)~ = 31.88, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics A); local retention (F~(6,96)~ = 40.90, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B); settlement success (F~(6,96)~ = 42.84, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C); and dispersal distance (F~(6,96)~ = 63.25, p \< 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The strategy of remaining close to the surface during all stages of ontogeny, i.e. Mullidae, produced the lowest self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and the furthest dispersal distance. In contrast, the strategy of migrating downwards with ontogeny, most pronounced in the Serranidae and Scorpaenidae strategies, increased self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success, and lowered the dispersal distances. Different OVM strategies did not produce any differences in richness (F~(6,96)~ = 1.11, p > 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A) or diversity (F~(6,96)~ = 0.79, p > 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). The strategies with the lowest connectance occurred with the Labridae and Scaridae strategies, while Synodontidae had the highest connectance values (@fig:settle-metrics C).

### Ontogenetic vertical migration methods

Ontogenetically migrating larvae daily produced different connectivity patterns to the OVM methods of stage and time step (R^2^ = 0.10; p = 0.005). The stage and time step methods had more consistent overlap of settlement patterns at most source regions (@fig:nmds-impl-std). The effect of daily migration was diminished in the southern regions (13-17), where more overlap between all three methods was observed. The central regions (6-9) showed the strongest regional variation, both between and within for OVM methods. The CAP analysis showed all three methods as dissimilar to each other, with stage marginally more similar to time step, than the daily method of OVM (@fig:cap-impl).

Comparisons of total settlement to regions found time step to have the most dissimilar settlement patterns (@fig:settlement-impl A). The differences were again driven by small regional differences, most notably an increased settlement at region 1 for stage and time step compared to the daily migration model (@fig:settlement-impl B).

There were significant differences between self-recruitment (F~(2,32)~ = 5.68, p < 0.05), the daily method having lower self-recruitment than stage based migration (@fig:conn-metrics A). Time step migration had the lowest mean local retention (F~(2,32)~ = 9.83, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics B) and settlement success (F~(2,32)~ = 32.48, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics C) between the OVM methods. Larvae in the daily and time step methods dispersed significantly further than the stage OVM method (F~(2,32)~ = 11.00, p < 0.05; @fig:conn-metrics D). The variation of dispersal distance for the daily OVM method had a standard deviation estimated to be 30% greater than the other methods. OVM methods did not have an effect on settlement site richness (F~(2,32)~ = 1.04, p \> 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics A) though there was an effect on diversity (F~(2,32)~ = 11.02, p < 0.05; @fig:settle-metrics B). This effect was caused by the OVM method of daily migration, which had lower settlement site diversity than the other OVM methods. However, the daily method of migration had the highest value of connectance (@fig:settle-metrics C).

### Overall context

The settlement patterns of the models in the behaviour scenario were the least similar of the three scenarios (@fig:all-cap), and the OVM methods scenario was less similar than the models with in the OVM strategies scenario. The models within the OVM strategy scenario were tightly clustered, suggesting minimal differences in settlement patterns occur with OVM strategies. The difference in connectivity patterns between the the OVM methods appeared to be equal or greater to the differences between the non-OHS models within the behavioural scenario. The OVM method of migrating at every time step had connectivity patterns most similar to the passive larvae advected vertically.

The first two axes explain 36.0% of the inertia.](chapters/theoretical/figs/all-cap.png){#fig:all-cap}

Differences in behaviour were more influential in determining the settlement richness, diversity, and connectance between regions (@fig:settle-metrics). Diversity was impacted more by changes in OVM method than the strategy choice (@fig:settle-metrics B). Similar trends were seen in amongst the connectivity metrics, where different behaviours effected the metrics more than changes within OVM strategy or OVM methodology (@fig:conn-metrics). The one exception is dispersal distance, which also exhibited variation with both different OVM strategies and methodologies (@fig:conn-metrics D).

Discussion

### Behavioural models

This study gives insight into the paradigm that ichthyoplankton can influence their dispersal patterns through horizontal and vertical swimming behaviours, by predicting how these patterns are affected using a biophysical dispersal model (BDM). Giving larval fish swimming behaviour in the models (vertical, horizontal, or both) did drive changes in the consequent modelled connectivity patterns. The connectivity patterns of the different behavioural models grouped into models that included or did not include orientated horizontal swimming (OHS). Swimming behaviour, horizontal and vertical, generally allowed ichthyoplankton to settle closer to their natal region (increasing local retention), reduce the distance of dispersal (restricting the connectivity pathways), and increased their chances of settlement success. The strength of this behavioural effect on connectivity patterns was noticeable with orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) and weakest with ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM). The compelling driver of the variation in connectivity patterns was the spawning location and presumably timing of spawning (not a factor in these permutations), which are known to be influential on connectivity [@cowen2009], more influential than vertical migration behaviours [@puckett2014]. Driving these connectivity patterns are the hydrodynamics of the coast off New South Wales (NSW), dominated by a poleward nearshore boundary current (the East Australia Current) that separates off the coast approximately at the location of regions 7 and 8 that generates mesoscale eddies that entrain ichthyoplankton [@suthers2011].

Orientated horizontal swimming (OHS) was the behaviour that affected the modelled connectivity patterns the greatest. Larvae with OHS behaviour increased local retention to the natal region, increased self-recruitment and reduced the dispersal distance. Giving larvae the ability to sense, orient, and swim towards a reef, also substantially increased their chances of settlement success. The reduced dispersal distance resulted in lower settlement richness, diversity, and connectance. These results are in agreement with modelling studies from other oceanographic locations that have seen OHS increase the local retention and self-recruitment of larval fish at similar levels [@wolanski2014a], and increase the settlement success and reduce the dispersal distance [@staaterman2012]. Bearing in mind the implementation of OHS in the BDM used in this study was closer to the implementation used by @staaterman2012 than @wolanski2014a. Aligned with the results of the models, its predicted ichthyoplankton that can sense and orientate towards a reef benefit with increased likelihood of settlement success and the ability to directly influence the the trajectory of dispersal. The effect of OHS on the connectivity patterns was so pronounced, that advecting larvae with vertical component in addition to OHS produced homologous patterns of connectivity. Even subsequent models with additional vertical behavioural traits only marginally altered the connectivity patterns. This strong influence of OHS behaviour on connectivity patterns, relative to the other behaviours (i.e. DVM and OVM), is likely the result of the directed nature of the swimming (towards viable settlement habitat) as much as the swimming speed itself. The ability to alter dispersal comes from larval being able to swim in the direction of a reef if they can swim faster than the prevailing current, while the other behaviours provide larvae mechanisms alter dispersal they are subject to the direction of the current, and can settle only when advected to a suitable habitat.

A good point but you then go nowhere with it.  You jump back into how OVM was not very different from passive-VA.  You can have a separate paragraph where you talk about this using your regional data.  How does the oceanography differ in the regions where OVM mattered compared to those where it didn’t?

Surprisingly, compared to the other behaviours, OVM did not have patterns that differed strongly from passive larvae, and had limited influence on the connectivity metrics. Local retention and settlement success were not affected when adding OVM to a passive model, only the self-recruitment of a region was increased. Larvae in the model exhibit vertical behaviour more during the pelagic larval stage than OHS (larvae only orientate and swim when a reef is sensed), therefore it was hypothesised that vertical migration would have a greater influence on the dispersal. Vertical migration occurs from an early onset of ontogeny, and changing position in the water column allows larvae to be advected by currents with different directions and velocities. In contrast, for horizontal swimming to influence connectivity patterns, the larvae has to be competent to settle, and within a sensory distance of the reef in order to orientate and swim towards the settlement habitat. Previous studies have found OVM to increase local retention [@paris2007a] and transform the connectivity patterns compared to non-swimming (passive) larvae [@butler2011]. Vertically migrating with ontogeny is considered a strong retention mechanism [@paris2004a], yet in this study the evidence for increased retention was weak. The results suggest the effect size of OVM on larval retention is dependent on the regional hydrodynamics, perhaps a combination of the influence of the nearshore boundary current and a limitation of the hydrodynamic model resolution in capturing the coastal dynamics. Local retention was highest when the EAC was closest to the coast and reduced dramatically at the separation zone. Non-swimming larvae that were moved by a vertical component (Passive+VA) had connectivity patterns that were more similar to models with OVM than the non-swimming passive larvae. Suggesting the vertical component advected larvae downwards at a slow rate, closely resembling the restricted movement of the stage based ontogenetic vertical migration used. Diel vertical migration (DVM) had a stronger effect on the connectivity patterns and connectivity metrics than OVM (where OVM used the stage based method described above), suggesting the frequency of vertical migration influences local retention. Connectivity models with DVM, similar to OVM, have been seen to increase settlement success, local retention and decreased the dispersal distance [@aiken2011; @robins2013; @butler2011]. The results of this study further confirm these previous findings.


### Ontogenetic vertical migration scenarios

The hypothesis that the strategy of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) would influence the patterns and metrics of dispersal was not supported. The effect of OVM strategy on the connectivity and settlement patterns was minimal, with only nuanced differences between strategies observed. The largest differences were seen between the direction of the vertical migration of the strategies, migrating the centre of mass upwards or downwards with increasing development. The direction of migration created a trade-off; upwards migration increased the dispersal distance, and downward migration increased local retention. This result partially correlates with similar observations, where ontogenetically migrating downwards has been shown to reduce transport [@huebert2011], however in this study no decreases in dispersal were seen for larvae migrating below 50 m. These results suggests that the choice of vertical migration strategy only has a small effect on dispersal. It follows that using generalised OVM data for modelling when the data for a specific species is unavailable, potentially has a minuscule effect on the modelled connectivity patterns, as long as the direction of migration is accurately defined, helped by the fact most species are known to migrate downwards with ontogeny [@cowen2002].

The hypothesis that the strategy of ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) would influence the patterns and metrics of dispersal was not supported. The effect of OVM strategy on the connectivity and settlement patterns was minimal, with only nuanced differences between strategies observed, especially compared with variation seen from the use of different behaviours. The largest differences were seen the taxa with upwards versus downwards OVM strategies. The direction of migration created a trade-off; upwards migration increased the dispersal distance, and downward migration increased local retention. This result partially correlates with similar observations, where ontogenetically migrating downwards has been shown to reduce transport [@huebert2011], however in this study no decreases in dispersal were seen for larvae migrating below 50 m. Migrating deeper with ontogeny reduces the overall dispersal distance, but it does increase the number of different areas settled, e.g. the genetic connectivity. These results suggest that the choice of vertical migration strategy only has a small effect on dispersal and it may be quite appropriate to utilise general parameter values where taxon-specific ones are not available as long as the general direction of migration is known.

The choice of method used to ontogenetically vertically migrate the larvae can affect the connectivity patterns, contrary to the prediction. In this study, migrating the larvae at an intermediate frequency (daily), had the strongest influence on the resultant connectivity patterns, with the fast migration (time step) and slow migration (stage) more similar to each other. These results are supported other research observing that the speed of vertical migration can alter the direction and distance of dispersal . The reason behind the connectivity patterns of daily migration being more similar to stage migration than time step migration is unclear. The speed of daily migration is closer to the speed seen in the time step migration and therefore the relationship would be expected to be reversed. A logical extension would be to give larvae different methods of migration, to account for the individual variation seen in larval fish [@nanninga2014].

The choice of method used to ontogenetically vertically migrate the larvae can effect the connectivity patterns, contrary to the prediction. When constructing a BDM, a modeller has to make many choices about how to encapsulate real world processes, and these results show that there are potential ramifications for these choices. While the frequency of ichthyoplankton vertical migration is unknown, these results suggest that fish migrating at an intermediate frequency (daily), had the strongest influence on the resultant connectivity patterns, with fast migration (time step) and slow migration (stage) strategies closer to each other. These results are supported by other research observing that the speed of vertical migration can alter the direction and distance of dispersal [@sundelof2012]. Changing position fast suggests the larval fish do not get the benefit of different velocities for sustained periods (in this model only two hours), and changing position with changes in ontogeny perhaps does not expose the larval to enough variation in current velocities. The BDM gives all larval the same migrating frequency, which may be unrealistic given the individual variation seen in larval fish [@nanninga2014].

### Context

When considering a biophysical dispersal model to measure connectivity of ichthyoplankton, the results of this study suggest that the choice of which behaviours to include is more important than the parameterisation or implementation method for OVM behaviour. For connectivity modelling, greater emphasises should be placed on what behaviours are specific to a species. General values for a behaviour (specifically OVM) can be utilised when no specific values are available in the literature without potentially influencing the patterns as much as choice of including the behaviour. For regions with nearshore boundary currents and species with limited empirical data on their ontogenetic vertical distribution , these results suggest that allowing passive larvae to migrate with a vertical component can produce similar patterns of connectivity. Interestingly, differences in the speed (method) of vertical migration were greater than differences in distribution (strategy). This results highlights the importance of the modelled behavioural processes. The modelling choice, however rational or arbitrary, can influence the patterns of connectivity more than the parameterisation. More robust knowledge of the processes behind these behaviours are fundamental to producing more accurate and precise connectivity pattern (e.g. speed of vertical migration, settlement detecting distance, and development of senses).

The strong effect of OHS raises the need for more empirical studies on the ability of different taxa to sense settlement habitat, the frequency at which they orientate towards sensed habitat and the sustained speeds at which the larvae swim towards the sensed habitat. In this BDM study, each settlement reef was considered to be equally attractive to the larval fish. This is unrealistic, as it has been demonstrated that reef fish can sense natal reefs [@bottesch2016] and can most likely discriminate between other sensed reefs. The settlement sensory distance was also kept constant for all larvae, which again doesn't reflect the individual variation of sensory abilities for larvae [@leis2014], and does not capture how settlement cues could be affected by hydrodynamics [i.e. odour, @gerlach2007a], location of sun [i.e. sight, @berenshtein2014a], or environmental variables such as temperature and salinity [i.e. sound, @sallares2009] . While out of scope for this study, further modelling studies should follow suggestions by @staaterman2014 and investigate the effect of different sensory abilities and their environmental cues on connectivity patterns.

Conclusion
----------

This study emphasises the importance of giving ichthyoplankton in biophysical dispersal models the ability to horizontally or vertically migrate, and not only passively advecting them by currents with a neutral buoyancy. Orientated horizontal swimming appears to be considerably influential on potential connectivity patterns. The caveat to including more behaviour in a biophysical dispersal model, is that parameterisation requires empirical knowledge that is often unavailable or limited for many species or taxa of ichthyoplankton. However, this study shows that for ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), in a region influenced by a nearshore boundary current, general taxa specific data might not give patterns much different to species-specific data. Further research should be considered on both the depth distributional patterns and the underlying processes of OVM (e.g. fast or slow frequency of migration), as changes in implementation method were seen to be influential on the dispersal of ichthyoplankton.
