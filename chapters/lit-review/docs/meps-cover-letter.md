Dear Editor,

We are please to submit our paper, “Making the right choices: understanding the impact of biophysical dispersal modelling on connectivity patterns“ for consideration for publication in your journal - Marine Ecology Progress Series. This submitted article is intended as a review article of the current literature of biological-physical connectivity modelling. It build upon a previous review article on ichthyoplankton transport models published in MEPS (Miller 2007), with a specific aim to identifying important parameters to include when undertaking a biophysical dispersal modelling study - useful for researchers, both modellers and ecologists interested in marine larval connectivity.

There does not appear to be a consensus in biophysical dispersal modelling, about the importance of the chosen parameters, specifically biological parameters and how it affects the output of the potential connectivity patterns. We aimed to firstly identify what parameters where being included in these models and comparing the results to Miller 2007, and to secondly tease out the importance of common modelling parameters by comparing the output of common metrics from 75 studies published since 2009. This was chosen as a starting date, due to the publication of an ICES manual on the recommend practices for biophysical dispersal modelling in this year. The four common metrics chosen across the studies were; local retention, self-recruitment, settlement success, and dispersal distance.
We found interesting patterns amongst the comparisons, such as model resolution not having a strong effect, mortality not greatly reducing settlement success and larval behaviour increasing the settlement success. Comparisons amongst all studies were not possible to the discrepancy of metrics used, suggesting to progress this field further we need to decide upon common metrics that allow meaningful comparisons between models, along with model validation against empirical results to start identifying the importance of different biophysical modelling parameters.

This is the first study we know of that attempts to quantify the output of biophysical dispersal models and to see how parameterisation of the model affects it.
