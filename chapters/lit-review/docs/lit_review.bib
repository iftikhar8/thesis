abstract = {This thesis explores a wellknown catalog of design patterns in the context of the programming language Scala. Design patterns do in general not exist as reusable components. Scala features novel abstraction mechanisms with a strong focus on the writing of components and is thus interesting to explore in the context of design patterns. General implementation problems concerning design patterns are identified. The analysis of the catalog shows that Scala can deal with some of these problems. Components for three patterns are provided, but in general Scala lacks the needed abstraction mechanisms. The principles behind design patterns, has long been regarded as sound engi- neering advice. The second principle, {\textquotedblleft}Favor object composition over class inher- itance{\textquotedblright}, is shown to be weakened in Scala. Further, a language feature proposal is presented, that if present in Scala in its full generality would result in the need for reevaluation of the principle.},

abstract = {Body size is closely linked to mortality rates in many animals, although the overarching patterns in this relationship have rarely been considered for multiple species. A meta-analysis of published size-specific mortality rates for coral reef fishes revealed an exponential decline in mortality rate with increasing body size, however, within this broad relationship there are three distinct phases. Phase one is characterized by naive fishes recruiting to reefs, which suffer extremely high mortality rates. In this well-studied phase, fishes must learn quickly to survive the many predation risks. After just a few days, the surviving fishes enter phase two, in which small increases in body size result in pronounced increases in lifespan (estimated 11 d mm{\textendash}1). Remarkably, approximately 50% of reef fish individuals remain in phase two throughout their lives. Once fishes reach a size threshold of about 43 mm total length (TL) they enter phase three, where mortality rates are relatively low and the pressure to grow is presumably, significantly reduced. These phases provide a clearer understanding of the impact of body size on mortality rates in coral reef fishes and begin to reveal critical insights into the energetic and trophic dynamics of coral reefs.},

abstract = {Pelagic dispersal of most benthic marine organisms is a fundamental driver of population distribution and persistence and is thought to lead to highly mixed populations. However, the mechanisms driving dispersal pathways of larvae along open coastlines are largely unknown. To examine the degree to which early stages can remain spatially coherent during dispersal, we measured genetic relatedness within a large pulse of newly recruited splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), a live-bearing fish whose offspring settle along the US Pacific Northwest coast after spending up to a year in the pelagic environment. A total of 11.6% of the recruits in a single recruitment pulse were siblings, providing the first evidence for persistent aggregation throughout a long dispersal period. Such protracted aggregation has profound implications for our understanding of larval dispersal, population connectivity, and gene flow within demersal marine populations.},

abstract = {Interactions between multiple ecosystem stressors are expected to jeopardize biological processes, functions and biodiversity. The scientific community has declared stressor interactions-notably synergies-a key issue for conservation and management. Here, we review ecological literature over the past four decades to evaluate trends in the reporting of ecological interactions (synergies, antagonisms and additive effects) and highlight the implications and importance to conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer terminologies, we find that synergies are (still) not the most prevalent type of interaction, and that conservation practitioners need to appreciate and manage for all interaction outcomes, including antagonistic and additive effects. However, it will not be possible to identify the effect of every interaction on every organism's physiology and every ecosystem function because the number of stressors, and their potential interactions, are growing rapidly. Predicting the type of interactions may be possible in the near-future, using meta-analyses, conservation-oriented experiments and adaptive monitoring. Pending a general framework for predicting interactions, conservation management should enact interventions that are robust to uncertainty in interaction type and that continue to bolster biological resilience in a stressful world.},

abstract = {We used an individual-based model of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) early life history coupled with hydrodynamic outputs from the regional oceanic modeling system (ROMS) to investigate the factors driving variability in egg and larval Survival rates in the northern Humboldt upwelling region off Peru. Individuals were released within a coastal area and followed for a period of 30 days. Those that were still in the coastal area at that time were considered as retained. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in the release locations of the individuals retained, and compared these to observed egg concentration patterns reconstructed from a 40-year period of monitoring. A first set of simulations using passive particles to represent anchovy eggs and larvae revealed a large sensitivity of the results to the initial vertical distribution of particles. We then conducted two additional sets of simulations that included the effect of egg buoyancy, larval vertical swimming behavior and lethal temperature. We obtained (1) maximal coastal retention close to the surface in winter and in deeper layers in summer, (2) a large influence of egg buoyancy and of larval vertical behavior on coastal retention in all seasons, (3) a partial match between dates and locations of enhanced retention and observed egg concentration patterns and (4) a low effect of lethal temperature on survival except when associated with high egg density. The model suggests that an optimal temporal spawning pattern for maximizing coastal retention would have two maximums, the most significant in austral winter and the second in summer. This pattern agrees roughly with observed spawning seasonality, but with temporal discrepancy of about two months in the peaks of both series. Spatially, we obtained higher retention from 10 S to 20 S, whereas the observed maximum egg concentration was located between 6 S and 14 S. Among the three sets of simulations, the one taking into account larval vertical swimming behavior lead to the best match with the data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ecological research is increasingly concentrated at particular locations or sites. This trend reflects a variety of advantages of intensive, site-based research, but also raises important questions about the nature of such spatially delimited research: how well does site based research represent broader areas, and does it constrain scientific discovery? We provide an overview of these issues with a particular focus on one prominent intensive research site: the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA. Among the key features of intensive sites are: long-term, archived data sets that provide a context for new discoveries and the elucidation of ecological mechanisms; the capacity to constrain inputs and parameters, and to validate models of complex ecological processes; and the intellectual cross-fertilization among disciplines in ecological and environmental sciences. The feasibility of scaling up ecological observations from intensive sites depends upon both the phenomenon of interest and the characteristics of the site. An evaluation of deviation metrics for the HBEF illustrates that, in some respects, including sensitivity and recovery of streams and trees from acid deposition, this site is representative of the Northern Forest region, of which HBEF is a part. However, the mountainous terrain and lack of significant agricultural legacy make the HBEF among the least disturbed sites in the Northern Forest region. Its relatively cool, wet climate contributes to high stream flow compared to other sites. These similarities and differences between the HBEF and the region can profoundly influence ecological patterns and processes and potentially limit the generality of observations at this and other intensive sites. Indeed, the difficulty of scaling up may be greatest for ecological phenomena that are sensitive to historical disturbance and that exhibit the greatest spatiotemporal variation, such as denitrification in soils and the dynamics of bird communities. Our research shows that end member sites for some processes often provide important insights into the behavior of inherently heterogeneous ecological processes. In the current era of rapid environmental and biological change, key ecological responses at intensive sites will reflect both specific local drivers and regional trends.},

abstract = {The coexistence of multiple species on a smaller number of limiting resources is an enduring ecological paradox. The mechanisms that maintain such biodiversity are of great interest to ecology and of central importance to conservation. We describe and prove a unique and robust mechanism for coexistence: Species that differ only in their dispersal abilities can coexist, if habitat patches are distributed at irregular distances. This mechanism is straightforward and ecologically intuitive, but can nevertheless create complex coexistence patterns that are robust to substantial environmental stochasticity. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is noted for its diversity of reef fish species and its complex arrangement of reef habitat. We demonstrate that this mechanism can allow fish species with different pelagic larval durations to stably coexist in the GBR. Further, coexisting species on the GBR often dominate different subregions, defined primarily by cross-shelf position. Interspecific differences in dispersal ability generate similar coexistence patterns when dispersal is influenced by larval behavior and variable oceanographic conditions. Many marine and terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by patchy habitat distributions and contain coexisting species that have different dispersal abilities. This coexistence mechanism is therefore likely to have ecological relevance beyond reef fish.},

Larval connectivity is a complex process to study as it is determined by several interacting factors. Here we use an individual-based, biophysical model, to disentangle the effects of such factors, namely larval vertical migration, larval growth, larval mortality, adults fecundity, and habitat availability, for the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (loco) in Chile. Lower transport success and higher dispersal distances are observed including larval vertical migration in the model. We find an overall decrease in larval transport success to settlement areas from northern to southern Chile. This spatial gradient results from the combination of current direction and intensity, seawater temperature, and available habitat. From our simulated connectivity patterns we then identify subpopulations of loco along the Chilean coast, which could serve as a basis for spatial management of this resource in the future.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas are usually static, permanently closed areas. There are, however, both social and ecological reasons to adopt dynamic closures, where reserves move through time. Using a general theoretical framework, we investigate whether dynamic closures can improve the mean biomass of herbivorous fishes on reef systems, thereby enhancing resilience to undesirable phase-shifts. At current levels of reservation (10-30%), moving protection between all reefs in a system is unlikely to improve herbivore biomass, but can lead to a more even distribution of biomass. However, if protected areas are rotated among an appropriate subset of the entire reef system (e.g. rotating 10 protected areas between only 20 reefs in a 100 reef system), dynamic closures always lead to increased mean herbivore biomass. The management strategy that will achieve the highest mean herbivore biomass depends on both the trajectories and rates of population recovery and decline. Given the current large-scale threats to coral reefs, the ability of dynamic marine protected areas to achieve conservation goals deserves more attention.},

abstract = {Predictions of organismal movements in a fluid require knowing the fluid's velocity and potential contributions of the organism's behaviour (e.g. swimming or flying). While theoretical aspects of this work are reasonably well-developed, field-based validation is challenging. A much-needed study recently published by Briscoe and colleagues in Proceedings of the Royal Society B compared movements and distribution of satellite-tracked juvenile sea turtles to virtual particles released in a data-assimilating hindcast ocean circulation model. Substantial differences observed between turtles and particles were considered evidence for an important role of active swimming by turtles. However, the experimental design implicitly assumed that transport predictions were insensitive to (i) start location, (ii) tracking duration, (iii) depth, and (iv) physical processes not depicted in the model. Here, we show that the magnitude of variation in physical parameters between turtles and virtual particles can profoundly alter transport predictions, potentially sufficient to explain the reported differences without evoking swimming behaviour. We present a more robust method to derive the environmental contributions to individual movements, but caution that resolving the ocean velocities experienced by individual organisms remains a problem for assessing the role of behaviour in organismal movements and population distributions.},

abstract = {Marine reserve theory suggests that where large, productive populations are protected within no-take marine reserves, fished areas outside reserves will benefit through the spillover of larvae produced in the reserves. However, empirical evidence for larval export has been sparse. Here we use a simple idealized coastline model to estimate the expected magnitude and spatial scale of larval export from no-take marine reserves across a range of reserve sizes and larval dispersal scales. Results suggest that, given the magnitude of increased production typically found in marine reserves, benefits from larval export are nearly always large enough to offset increased mortality outside marine reserves due to displaced fishing effort. However, the proportional increase in recruitment at sites outside reserves is typically small, particularly for species with long-distance (on the order of hundreds of kilometers) larval dispersal distances, making it very difficult to detect in field studies. Enhanced recruitment due to export may be detected by sampling several sites at an appropriate range of distances from reserves or at sites downcurrent of reserves in systems with directional dispersal. A review of existing empirical evidence confirms the model's suggestion that detecting export may be difficult without an exceptionally large differential in production, short-distance larval dispersal relative to reserve size, directional dispersal, or a sampling scheme that encompasses a broad range of distances from the reserves.},

abstract = {Feeding success is essential to larval fish survival. We present detailed mechanistic models of the foraging processes (prey encounter, approach, pursuit, and capture) in larval fish, where all parameters have explicit physical or biological meaning. The model is a unification of the processes believed to be important to prey selectivity and environmental regulation of feeding in fish. We include the sensitivity of prey to the hydrodynamic signal generated by approaching larval fish and a simple model of the potential loss of prey due to turbulence whereby prey is lost if it leaves the perceptive field during pursuit time. We parameterise the model for larval cod Gadus morhua L., a species for which data from numerous experimental and field studies are available. Model predictions are compared to observations of feeding rates under various conditions and appear to match estimated ingestion rates and prey selection in larval cod. Observed pursuit times of larvae are long and approach velocity slow enough to avoid an escape response from prey, but too short to avoid loss of prey at high turbulence levels. The pause-travel search mode is predicted to promote ingestion of larger prey than a cruising search mode. We use these models to evaluate temporal and spatial (vertical) diel feeding rates of larval cod across Georges Bank. Contrary to previous models, our model suggests that larval cod are food-limited only in deep waters along a 160 km transect of the bank at a prey concentration of 20 jig dry wt l(-1). The spatio-temporal fluctuation of turbulence (tidal cycle) and light (sun height) over the bank generates complex structure in the patterns of food intake of larval fish, with different patterns emerging for small and large larvae.},

abstract = {With the arrival of GPS, satellite remote sensing, and personal computers, the last two decades have witnessed rapid advances in the field of spatially-explicit marine ecological modeling. But with this innovation has come complexity. To keep up, ecologists must master multiple specialized software packages, such as ArcGIS for display and manipulation of geospatial data, R for statistical analysis, and MATLAB for matrix processing. This requires a costly investment of time and energy learning computer programming, a high hurdle for many ecologists. To provide easier access to advanced analytic methods, we developed Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), an extensible collection of powerful, easy-to-use, open-source geoprocessing tools that ecologists can invoke from ArcGIS without resorting to computer programming. Internally, MGET integrates Python, R, MATLAB, and C{\th}{\th}, bringing the power of these specialized platforms to tool developers without requiring developers to orchestrate the interoperability between them.In this paper, we describe MGET{\textquoteright}s software architecture and the tools in the collection. Next, we present an example application: a habitat model for Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that predicts dolphin presence using a statistical model fitted with oceanographic predictor variables. We conclude by discussing the lessons we learned engineering a highly integrated tool framework.

abstract = {Demographic connectivity is a fundamental process influencing the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations. Consequently, quantifying connectivity is essential for properly designing networks of protected areas so that they achieve their core ecological objective of maintaining population persistence. Recently, many empirical studies in marine systems have provided essential, and historically challenging to obtain, data on patterns of larval dispersal and export from marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we review the empirical studies that have directly quantified the origins and destinations of individual larvae and assess those studies' relevance to the theory of population persistence and MPA design objectives. We found that empirical studies often do not measure or present quantities that are relevant to assessing population persistence, even though most studies were motivated or contextualized by MPA applications. Persistence of spatial populations, like nonspatial populations, de...},

abstract = {The dispersal of larvae and their settlement to suitable habitat is fundamental to the replenishment of marine populations and the communities in which they live. Sound plays an important role in this process because for larvae of various species, it acts as an orientational cue towards suitable settlement habitat. Because marine sounds are largely of biological origin, they not only carry information about the location of potential habitat, but also information about the quality of habitat. While ocean acidification is known to affect a wide range of marine organisms and processes, its effect on marine soundscapes and its reception by navigating oceanic larvae remains unknown. Here, we show that ocean acidification causes a switch in role of present-day soundscapes from attractor to repellent in the auditory preferences in a temperate larval fish. Using natural CO2 vents as analogues of future ocean conditions, we further reveal that ocean acidification can impact marine soundscapes by profoundly diminishing their biological sound production. An altered soundscape poorer in biological cues indirectly penalizes oceanic larvae at settlement stage because both control and CO2-treated fish larvae showed lack of any response to such future soundscapes. These indirect and direct effects of ocean acidification put at risk the complex processes of larval dispersal and settlement.},

abstract = {The bipartite life history of most marine organisms leads to complex patterns of replenishment in benthic populations. High variation in adult spawning, dynamic oceanographic currents, and often unknown larval behaviors create challenges in accurately predicting spatial and temporal patterns in the supply and settlement of pelagic larvae to nearshore juvenile habitats. Yet, understanding and predicting larval exchange underlies population dynamics, ecological interactions, and conservation practices. We compared observed patterns of larval settlement of the bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus (Pomacentridae) along the Florida Keys, USA, to those obtained through model simulations using a high-resolution biophysical model parameterized with species-specific early life-history information. Light traps intercepted settlement-stage larvae, and divers censused new recruits at 2 replicate reefs in each of the upper (eastern) (UK) and lower (western) Keys (LK) during 6 peak settlement periods. Damselfish settlement and recruitment to the LK consistently exceeded that to the UK. Remarkably, model simulations successfully explained 70% of temporal variation in settlement within each region. However, the model did not capture the relative magnitude of observed settlement between the regions: settlement was either overestimated in the UK or underestimated in the LK. Potential causes include weak larval settlement cues or larval ability to navigate and swim to settlement habitat in the UK, higher larval condition and survival in the more productive waters of the LK, or substantial spatial variation in reproductive output. Connectivity matrices indicate that a majority of S. partitus settlement to the Florida Keys is sourced from Keys populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Modelling physical-biological interactions in the early life of fish is becoming an integral part of theoretical and applied marine ecology. A workshop on 'Advancements in modelling physical-biological interactions in fish early-life history' (WKAMF) was held in April 2006 to review recent developments and identify future research directions. Here we provide an overview of the information presented at WKAMF (some of which is published in this Theme Section), discussions that took place at the workshop, and the authors' perspectives as workshop co-Chairs. The major themes identified at the workshop were the need for enhanced model validation and sensitivity methods and improved understanding of physical and biological processes. Using the appropriate level of model complexity required for each model application is important; developing quantitative consistency of model results with good quality observational data is critical. In addition, improving our prediction of physical processes, such as circulation patterns and turbulence, will advance our knowledge of fish early life, as will a better understanding of biological processes like mortality, behaviour, and energetics. The latter stage-dependent, often species-specific, processes pose particular challenges, although technical advances in field and laboratory observations are likely to result in considerable progress in the near future. Finally, there is a clear requirement for interdisciplinary collaboration between modellers, field scientists and laboratory scientists. Studies receiving input from a wide range of disciplines will increase our understanding of fish early-life ecology and prediction of recruitment to fish populations.},

abstract = {We examine the hypothesis that reef fish larvae have some direct influence on their own dispersal and ability to recruit to their natal reef by tracking cohorts of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) from hatching to settlement onto the reef, about 30 d later. We conducted high-resolution sampling during two consecutive years in a small area (15 km X 20 km) off the west coast of Barbados, extending from depths of 0 to 100 m. Observations of discrete stage-specific larval patches of mean size of 29.4 and 13.2 km(2) for preflexion (1-5-d old) and flexion/postflexion (>5-d old) stages extending ca. 30 In in the vertical indicated that larvae initially dispersing as patches tend to stay in coherent patches throughout their pelagic duration. Highest concentrations of preflexion larvae within a patch were in the upper 20 m, while those of older larvae were always deeper. Downward migration of about 60 m throughout ontogeny within stratified currents represented a retention mechanism for locally spawned larvae. Most of the variability in estimated retention rates between daily cohorts occurred during the earliest stages as a result of the dynamic nature of surface currents experienced by larvae prior to the onset of vertical migration. Differences in residence time between experiments were consistent with observed intermonthly variability in recruitment strength, implying that pelagic processes can explain recruitment rates. These results provide empirical evidence for larval retention of coral reef fishes and stress the role of active behavior in larval transport.},

In response, place-based strategies involve communities and resource users in management have proliferated. Here, we present a transferable community-based approach to assess the social and ecological factors affecting resource sustainability and food security in a small-scale, coral reef fishery. Our results show that this small-scale fishery provides large-scale benefits to communities, including 7,353 {\textpm} 1547 kg yr -1 (mean {\textpm} SE) of seafood per year, equating to {\&}gt;30,000 meals with an economic value of $78,432. The vast majority of the catch is used for subsistence, contributing to community food security: 58% is kept, 33.5% is given away, and 8.5% is sold. Our spatial analysis assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the fishery (the {\textquotedblleft}food shed{\textquotedblright} for the fishery), and we document that 20% of seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with significant implications for conservation and management. This interdisciplinary effort aims to demonstrate a transferable participatory research approach useful for resource-dependent communities as they cope with socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental change.},

abstract = {Population genetic theory and empirical comparisons of sister and sympatric marine species show that life-history traits related to dispersal, such as pelagic duration (PD), should affect the frequency and spatial scale of migration and thus influence population genetic structure. However, recent global analyses have concluded that PD is poorly correlated with marine population genetic structure. Here, we identify and compare genetic structure between four pairs of synchronously diverging co-distributed (SDC) species, drawn from standardized analyses of eight eastern North Pacific rocky intertidal invertebrates and a macrophyte. We test two hypotheses: (H0) that species with similar dispersal potential have similar population genetic structure and (H1) that species with higher dispersal potential have lower population genetic differentiation. We find that differences in census population size (Nc), fecundity (F), and PD are sufficient to explain measured differences in population genetic structure ($\varphi$ST, D...},

abstract = {Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.},

abstract = {Many nearshore fish and invertebrate populations are overexploited even when apparently coherent management structures are in place. One potential cause of mismanagement may be a poor understanding and accounting of stochasticity, particularly for stock recruitment. Many of the fishes and invertebrates that comprise nearshore fisheries are relatively sedentary as adults but have an obligate larval pelagic stage that is dispersed by ocean currents. Here, we demonstrate that larval connectivity is inherently an intermittent and heterogeneous process on annual time scales. This stochasticity arises from the advection of pelagic larvae by chaotic coastal circulations. This result departs from typical assumptions where larvae simply diffuse from one site to another or where complex connectivity patterns are created by transport within spatially complicated environments. We derive a statistical model for the expected variability in larval settlement patterns and demonstrate how larval connectivity varies as a function of different biological and physical processes. The stochastic nature of larval connectivity creates an unavoidable uncertainty in the assessment of fish recruitment and the resulting forecasts of sustainable yields.},

abstract = {The goals of this study were to measure vertical distributions of pelagic coral reef fish larvae, identify significant vertical migrations, and estimate the effects of vertical migrations between depths with different ambient currents on larval transport in the Straits of Florida. Spring, summer, and fall time-series of plankton net tows were conducted at the edge of the Florida Current offshore of Miami. In each time-series the upper 100 m of the water column at a fixed station was sampled repeatedly at 3-h intervals for two diel cycles, with different nets sampling at five discrete depth ranges. Simultaneously, currents-at-depth were recorded by shipboard current profilers. Mean and standard deviation of larval depth and statistically significant vertical migrations were determined by nonparametric resampling and tree regression techniques. In 10 taxa, larvae showed ontogenic vertical migrations, gradually moving deeper with growth and development. Vertical distributions of six taxa varied between day and night, revealing diel vertical migrations. Larval transport was estimated by generating progressive vector diagrams from current measurements and larval vertical distributions. The dominant alongshore component of the Florida Current resulted in rapid larval transport through the Straits of Florida, while cross-shore current was an order of magnitude weaker and highly variable. Larvae at depths > 70 m experienced a 15-75% reduction in transport; thus, deep vertical distributions and downward vertical migrations potentially favor retention and settlement in the Straits of Florida.},

abstract = {Variations in larval fish growth rates are largely the result of variability in biotic and abiotic characteristics of the feeding environment experienced by each individual. An assessment of an individual{\textquoteright}s overall feeding success (i.e. accumulation of utilizable organic matter) can best be achieved at the time of capture when the relationships among environment, short-term feeding success as defined by gut content and long-term feeding success as defined by accumulated growth can be contrasted. Here, we investigated the relationships between average growth, feeding success, and variability in individual growth and feeding rates across a range of taxa based on a synthesis of studies in which stomach content and otolith growth were measured in the same individuals. Instantaneous measures of feeding success were highly variable and demonstrated a positive yet somewhat limited association with growth rates across all taxa. The strength of the feeding-growth relationships among taxa, and cohorts within taxa, was reflected in the autocorrelation of individual growth rates, suggesting that stable growth was achieved through consistent feeding success. However, when viewed at the individual level, faster growth was achieved in individuals with more variable growth rates, and by inference more variable past feeding success. The dichotomy in these underlying relationships may point to the importance of stochastic events in the develop- ment of exceptional individuals in a population, and may be linked to how surplus energy is allocated to individual growth rates. The positive cor- relation found between feeding success and growth in all taxa is consistent with the growth-survival paradigm for the larval stage of fish. However, both the correlation between feeding success and growth and the serial correlation of growth time-series was greatest in fast-growing species, sug- gesting that the potential for an early {\textquotedblleft}critical period{\textquotedblright} regulating survival varies among species, reaching a maximum in fast-growing fish. },

abstract = {Lagrangian stochastic (LS) modeling is a common technique in atmospheric boundary layer modeling but is relatively new in coastal oceanography. This paper presents some fundamental aspects of LS modeling as they pertain to oceanography. The theory behind LS modeling is reviewed and an introduction to the substantial atmospheric literature on the subject is provided. One of the most important properties of an LS model is that it maintains an initially uniform distribution of particles uniform for all time-the well-mixed condition (WMC). Turbulent data for use in an oceanic LS model (LSM) are typically output at discrete positions by a general circulation model. Tests for the WMC are devised, and it is shown that for inhomogeneous turbulence the data output by an oceanic general circulation model is such that the WMC cannot be demonstrated. It is hypothesized that this is due to data resolution problems. To test this hypothesis analytical turbulence data are constructed and output at various resolutions to show that the WMC can only be demonstrated if the resolution is high enough (the required resolution depending on the inhomogeneity of the turbulence data). The output of an LSM represents one trial of possible ensemble and this paper seeks to learn the ensemble average properties of the dispersion. This relates to the number of particles or trials that are performed. Methods for determining the number of particles required to have statistical certainty in one's results are demonstrated, and two possible errors that can occur when using too few particles are shown.},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of connectivity among populations of marine organisms is essential for the development of realistic, spatially explicit models of population dynamics. Two approaches, empirical genetic patterns and oceanographic dispersal modelling, have been used to estimate levels of evolutionary connectivity among marine populations but rarely have their potentially complementary insights been combined. Here, a spatially realistic Lagrangian model of larval dispersal and a theoretical genetic model are integrated with the most extensive study of gene flow in a Caribbean marine organism. The 871 genets collected from 26 sites spread over the wider Caribbean subsampled 45.8% of the 1900 potential unique genets in the model. At a coarse scale, significant consensus between modelled estimates of genetic structure and empirical genetic data for populations of the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis is observed. However, modelled and empirical data differ in their estimates of connectivity among northern Mesoamerican reefs indicating that processes other than dispersal may dominate here. Further, the geographic location and porosity of the previously described east-west barrier to gene flow in the Caribbean is refined. A multi-prong approach, integrating genetic data and spatially realistic models of larval dispersal and genetic projection, provides complementary insights into the processes underpinning population connectivity in marine invertebrates on evolutionary timescales.},

abstract = {The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) population of Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) has exhibited high variability in recruitment to the commercially exploited stock since the late 1970s. Concurrently, apparent shifts in crab distribution have also been observed. Larval advection patterns and associated local retention offer a potential mechanism for these observations. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was used to simulate larval Tanner crab advection patterns over 1978{\textendash}2004 based on larval hatching sites inferred from the distributions of reproductive females sampled during annual National Marine Fisheries Service trawl surveys. Connectivity among EBS subregions was examined by comparing start and end float loca- tions after 60 days of simulated drift. High levels of retention (>50% of floats) were observed in the major- ity of source subregions, and contributed significantly to the total number of endpoints in each region. Patterns in advection and resultant interregional connectivity were variable, with strongest sustained connectivity occurring along shelf, within individual domains. Increased settlement potential in the outer domain and southern middle domain after 1990 is consistent with an observed geographic shift in fishery productivity. Apparent reliance of Bristol Bay on local larval retention validates recent spatial fishery management to conserve this area as a subpopulation.￼},

abstract = {Morphological development of the larvae of the Ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, is described from 34 reared specimens (2.5-13.0 mm standard length), and two wild settlement-stage larvae (10.8-11.3 mm) captured in light traps. Reared larvae emerged from demersal eggs at c. 2.5 mm, underwent notochord flexion at 4.0-4.5 mm, and settled at 11-13 mm at 19-21 days after hatching (within the known range for wild larvae). Reared larvae grew at 0.3 turn day(-1) (preflexion) to 0.5 mm day(-1) (postflexion). Development was direct with few specializations for pelagic existence and was typical of pomacentrids. Head spination consisted of very weak spines on the preopercle, opercle, interopercle, subopercle and supracleithrum. Development of the olfactory system and retina are also described. A summary of published descriptions of early life-history stages of pomacentrid damselfishes is provided (n = 15% of known species). Larvae of several genera (e.g. Abudefduf, Chromis and Stegastes) are deeper-bodied and more 'hunchbacked' than P. amboinensis. Larvae of other genera (e.g. Amblyglyphidodon, Chrysiptera and Neoglyphidodon) are similar to P amboinensis. Larvae of only three other Pomacentrus species have been described, and they are similar to P. amboinensis in body morphology, pigmentation and head spination.

abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to metapopulation dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection-diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory-an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50-150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island 'stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connecting distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be prioritized for marine conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {In marine benthic ecosystems, larval connectivity is a major process influencing the maintenance and distribution of invertebrate populations. Larval connectivity is a complex process to study as it is determined by several interacting factors. Here we use an individual-based, biophysical model, to disentangle the effects of such factors, namely larval vertical migration, larval growth, larval mortality, adults fecundity, and habitat availability, for the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (loco) in Chile. Lower transport success and higher dispersal distances are observed including larval vertical migration in the model. We find an overall decrease in larval transport success to settlement areas from northern to southern Chile. This spatial gradient results from the combination of current direction and intensity, seawater temperature, and available habitat. From our simulated connectivity patterns we then identify subpopulations of loco along the Chilean coast, which could serve as a basis for spatial management of this resource in the future.},

abstract = {Ecological traps, which occur when animals mistakenly prefer habitats where their fitness is lower than in other available habitats following rapid environmental change, have important conservation and management implications. Empirical research has focused largely on assessing the behavioural effects of traps, by studying a small number of geographically close habitat patches. Traps, however, have also been defined in terms of their population-level effects (i.e. as preferred habitats of sufficiently low quality to cause population declines), and this is the scale most relevant for management. We systematically review the ecological traps literature to (i) describe the geographical and taxonomic distribution of efforts to study traps, (ii) examine how different traps vary in the strength of their effects on preference and fitness, (iii) evaluate the robustness of methods being used to identify traps, and (iv) determine whether the information required to assess the population-level consequences of traps has been considered. We use our results to discuss key knowledge gaps, propose improved methods to study traps, and highlight fruitful avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Behavior such as ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) limits the transport of marine larvae with short pelagic larval durations (PLDs), but its effect on the supposed long-distance disper- sal of larvae with long PLDs is unknown. We conducted laboratory tests of ontogenetic change in lar- val phototaxis and examined size-specific patterns of larval distribution in the plankton to character- ize OVM in the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus during its long (6 mo) PLD. We then used a coupled biophysical model to explore the consequences of OVM and hydrodynamics on larval P. argus dispersal in the Caribbean Sea. Larvae reared in the laboratory were positively phototatic for the first 2 mo and then avoided light thereafter, similar that seen in the planktonic distribution of same-sized larvae. Simulations of larval dispersal from 13 spawning sites in the Caribbean Sea pre- dicted that twice as many larvae would recruit to nurseries if they displayed OVM compared with passive dispersers. Larvae with OVM typically settled <400 km from where they were spawned, while passive dispersers often settled >1000 km away. OVM also produced an asymmetrical bimodal pattern of dispersal dominated by larvae that settled near their origin ({\textasciitilde}60%), but showed a second peak of larvae that dispersed over long distances ({\textasciitilde}20%). Hydrodynamics created subregional differ- ences in the potential for self-recruitment. Our findings suggest that (1) larval behavior constrains the dispersal of even long-lived larvae, particularly in tandem with retentive oceanographic environ- ments, and (2) larval sources of P. argus in the Caribbean Sea cannot be estimated from passive trans- port and surface circulation.},

abstract = {In the NW Mediterranean Sea, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are the most important small pelagic fish in terms of biomass and commercial interest. Round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) and Sprat (Sprattus sprattus) are also present in this region. This paper provides a general insight into the ecology of these species through a revision of the information available in an environmental context and in relation to exploitation features. Spawning habitats of the two main species, anchovy and sardine, are clearly differentiated based on water mass characteristics reducing the overlapping between their early developmental stages. Larval distribution is also related to major productivity mechanisms of the respective spawning seasons. In spite of the different environmental regimes in which larvae of these species develop, growth rates are fairly similar. Trophic modeling highlights the important ecological role of small pelagic fish in North Western Mediterranean ecosystems. This review points out the gaps in knowledge necessary to understand the dynamics of small pelagic fish in the region and to progress towards a precautionary and adaptive management.

abstract = {Successful larval dispersal between coral reef populations is one of the key determinants of coral reef connectivity. Dispersal patterns are generally predicted using hydrodynamic models, but these are frequently constrained by a lack of information on larval biology. This study examines some of the life history traits that may affect coral larval transport and hence be useful for dispersal models, in particular their settlement competency periods and vertical distribution in the water column, which we hypothesized would occur synchronously. The settlement competencies of the larvae of two species of broadcast spawning scleractinian corals. Pectinia lactuca and Platygyra sinensis were followed for up to 16 d. Larvae of both species were able to settle within the first 2 d after the spawning event. Peak settlement of P. lactuca larvae was shortly after day three post-fertilization with 71.6 +/- 4.8% of live larvae being able to settle, while peak settlement of P. sinensis larvae was delayed till the sixth day with 85.1 +/- 4.0% of live larvae settling. Given their later peak settlement and extended settlement window, larvae of P. sinensis potentially have a larger dispersal potential than P. lactuca, which is consistent with the geographical ranges of the two species. Changes in the daytime depth distribution of larvae of three species of broadcast spawning scleractinian corals, P. lactuca, P. sinensis, and Acropora hyacinthus were followed using water-filled 2 m vertical tubes. A downward shift over time in the vertical distribution of all three species was observed, which could affect larval transport patterns due to the possible stratification of horizontal currents. Sinking rate, however, was not necessarily consistent with their peak settlement competency periods. Such inconsistencies between settlement and sinking suggest that larvae may not settle even when they are capable of doing so due to their vertical distribution in the water column. This has implications for dispersal models which traditionally rely on settlement competencies, as larval vertical position may alter the timing of settlement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a continental archipelagic system of 5000 reefs and shoals stretching >2000 km along the east Australia coast. The interconnectivity of these reefs should determine the choice of biological management units, which for most biota will reflect the dispersal of their eggs and/or larvae. A comparative approach using population genetics was used to ask whether the along-shore dispersal of coral reef fishes is influenced by the duration of this mobile phase. Seven species of coral reef fish, selected from three families to provide a range of taxonomic diversity and pelagic larval durations, were tested for genetic homogeneity between two regions of the GBR separated by 1000 km. A spectrum of potential dispersal capabilities was analyzed from that of Acanthochromis polyacanthus, a damselfish with brood care that uniquely lacks pelagic larvae, to that of Ctenochaetus striatus, a surgeonfish with large, specialized larvae that spend several months in the plankton. A total of 19 enzyme systems and general proteins were examined from multiple populations in each region to provide a base of 32 loci for these comparisons. With one exception, species sampled from different coral reefs within regions showed statistically significant heterogeneities across multiple loci, indicative of chaotic genetic patchiness among the samples. The exception was an anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus, that had to be collected from large areas on each reef because of its law densities. The homogeneity of allele frequencies at local scales for this species suggests that the genetic patchiness observed in others may be a within-reef phenomenon that was manifested at the reef scale by our pseudoreplicated sampling strategy. After pooling local variability, all but two species showed significant regional differences. The exceptions were the pair (Ctenochaetus striatus, Pterocaesio chrysozona) with the longest larval durations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus showed increased variation at this larger scale, consistent with a major stock division between the two regions. The logarithm of genetic Variation between northern and southern populations (measured by Weir and Cockerham's F-st) was correlated with mean larval duration by an inverse linear relationship that explained 85% of the variance in the global data set. Comparison with an outgroup (Amphiprion melanopus from the Chesterfield Reefs, 1000 km east in the Coral Sea) confirmed the genetic cohesion of mainland populations for the species with shortest larval duration and shows that our empirical relationship applies only within the context of the highly connected GBR. On this basis, calculations of gene flow (N(e)m, the number of effective migrants per generation) between geographic regions predict panmixis for species with larval durations exceeding I mo. Many common species have shorter dispersal times, from which classical ''isolation-by-distance'' models predict differentiation between northern and southern populations at genetic equilibrium. Given that modern populations on the GBR are <10 000 yr old, however, there has not been sufficient time for such differences to evolve in situ and we consider alternative scenarios for the observed heterogeneities. Comparisons with invertebrate taxa sampled over the same spatial scales imply lower gene flows in fish despite longer pelagic durations. This suggests that fish larvae may use their greater mobility to retard, rather than enhance, dispersal due to hydrodynamic advection.},

abstract = {Behavior of settlement-stage (10-17 mm SL) larvae of five chaetodontid species (Chaetodon auriga, C. aureofasciatus, C. rainfordi, C. plebeius, and Chelmon rostratus) captured in light traps was investigated in open water and over coral reefs at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Average swimming speeds of all species in open water (18-26 cm s(-1)) were greater than average current speeds; larvae swam several meters deeper off the deeper east side of the island than off the west side, and most larvae swam directionally. Near coral reefs, about 37% of larvae swam offshore at speeds that were frequently greater than those at which they swam toward or over reefs. After a mean of 5 min, 40% of larvae reaching reefs swam away offshore, many after harassment by resident fishes. About 5% were eaten; the rest settled in a mean of 2 min. Chaetodon plebeius never settled. Non-predatory resident fishes strongly influenced the distribution of butterflyfish settlers. The three species that settled in usable numbers had species-specific settlement depths and substratum, primarily live corals. Comparing these results to studies on larger juveniles shows that individuals become increasingly selective about habitat (usually coral taxa) as they grow. Larval settlement behavior of chaetodontids is more similar to that of pomacentrids than that of lutjanids or serranids, but some features are shared by all families.},

abstract = {Dispersal of larval propagules is the major mechanism facilitating connectivity of marine populations. However, only a fraction of larvae settle in suitable habitat. For coral reef fishes, many larvae are advected away from coral reefs, often despite strong behavioural mechanisms (including swimming), and some may travel long distances away from the tropics. Here we document the occurrence of tropical reef fishes along the southeast coast of Australia between 2003 and 2005 and evaluate the role of the East Australian Current (EAC) in driving this pattern. In total we observed 47 species of tropical fishes from 11 families during the summer recruitment season (January to May) at locations spanning most of the length of the New South Wales coast (28 degrees S-37.5 degrees S latitude, similar to 1700 km from the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef). Southern locations tended to have reduced richness and density relative to northern ones. In general, the southward extent of distribution of the most commonly observed species was well explained by their planktonic larval durations. Recruitment events tended to be much more episodic in Merimbula (37 degrees S) than Sydney (34 degrees S), but there was little evidence for interannual similarity in the spatial patterns of recruitment of individual species with exception of the numerical dominance of Abudefduf vaigiensis and Abudefduf sexfasciatus (Pomacentridae) at the Sydney location and of Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon flavirostris (Chaetodontidae) at the Merimbula location. Despite strong evidence for the role of the EAC in the transport of these species at a coastal scale, we found little evidence that individual recruitment events were correlated with local increases in water temperature that would be associated with EAC ingress.

abstract = {Marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as conservation and fishery management tools. It is argued that they can protect ecosystems and also benefit fisheries via density-dependent spillover of adults and enhanced larval dispersal into fishing areas. However, while evidence has shown that marine reserves can meet conservation targets, their effects on fisheries are less understood. In particular, the basic question of if and over what temporal and spatial scales reserves can benefit fished populations via larval dispersal remains unanswered. We tested predictions of a larval transport model for a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico, via field oceanography and repeated density counts of recently settled juvenile commercial mollusks before and after reserve establishment. We show that local retention of larvae within a reserve network can take place with enhanced, but spatially-explicit, recruitment to local fisheries. Enhancement occurred rapidly (2 yrs), with up to a three-fold increase in density of juveniles found in fished areas at the downstream edge of the reserve network, but other fishing areas within the network were unaffected. These findings were consistent with our model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of protecting larval sources and show that enhancement in recruitment can be manifested rapidly. However, benefits can be markedly variable within a local seascape. Hence, effects of marine reserve networks, positive or negative, may be overlooked when only focusing on overall responses and not considering finer spatially-explicit responses within a reserve network and its adjacent fishing grounds. Our results therefore call for future research on marine reserves that addresses this variability in order to help frame appropriate scenarios for the spatial management scales of interest.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship between blood glucose concentration and perceived exertion during prolonged low-intensity exercise. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven young healthy males began bicycle exercise from 0800 h at 50% Vo2max. One hour after initiation of the exercise, 20% glucose was infused by means of an infusion pump, to maintain blood glucose concentration at a level of approximately 6.5 mM for 20 min. This was followed by 20 min of sham infusion (no glucose). This 40-min cycle was repeated until 220 min of exercise. During the first 120 min of exercise, the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) increased gradually without any effects of the glucose infusion. Thereafter, RPE tended to decrease during glucose infusion, and finally showed a significant decrease from 180 (17 +/- 2) to 190 (16 +/- 2) min. This result showed that an increase in blood glucose concentration has a significant effect on perceived exertion, even if exercise time is prolonged. The different responses of RPE during the two phases of the exercise may be explained by the difference of glycogen concentration in muscle, because glucose infusion had no effect on RPE when muscle glycogen content was presumed to be at normal level, and was effective when glycogen in the exercising muscles was presumed to be depleted.},

abstract = {The effect of environmental variables on the vertical structure of larval fish assemblages in a tropical coastal lagoon was analyzed. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected from the near-bottom and surface strata near the mouth of a subtropical lagoon during contrasting seasonal conditions of temperature, photoperiod, light intensity, and tidal heights. During summer, larval fish assemblages had high species richness (R) and were dominated by tropical species. During winter, assemblages had lower R values and were dominated by subtropical and temperate species. Vertical distribution patterns of the taxa were determined by the interaction of environmental variables and behavior of each species to maintain their position in a stratum in the water column, or to achieve vertical migrations induced by environmental stimuli that, in this case, were thermal gradient, column water stratification, and intensity of light. Depth position and vertical migration of fish larvae, coupled with the flood and ebb tide conditions, played an important role in their retention and displacement toward the lagoon. Fish larvae with distribution restricted to the inner part of the inlet, such as Achirus mazatlanus, Etropus sp., and several gobies, were more abundant in the near-bottom stratum during the ebb tide, allowing them to avoid exportation, whereas those that could spawn outside, but depended on the inlet as a nursery area, were more abundant near the surface during flood tide, such as Abudefduf troschelii and Stegastes rectifraenum.

Survival response surfaces are used to illustrate the relative effects of episodic and subtle mortality during early life. It is the subtle variability associated with small changes in growth or mortality rates that may exert the greater effect on recruitment. Massive advective losses of eggs or larvae, failed egg production, and acute contaminant mortalities are examples of episodic events that may impact recruitment significantly but which need not be catastrophic. Stabilization of recruitments through density-dependent growth rate variability in early life is demonstrated to be potentially important. Whether this mechanism actually is important in the sea remains to be determined. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Development of sergeant major, Abudefduf saxatilis, from late egg to early juvenile is described from captive-spawned and wild eggs and 71 laboratory-reared specimens. General morphological features include lateral compression, deep head, deep abdomen, and increasing preanal length through transformation. Notochord flexion had started in a 10-d old, 5.3 mm TL larva. Flexion was complete by 9.2 mm TL (17 d) and transformation at about 18.7 mm TL (28 d). Pelvic spines and rays developed during early preflexion (4.2 mm TL). The caudal fin began development at 4.4 mm TL. During preflexion (5.0 mm TL), dorsal rays and spines were present, and the anal fin began forming. Anal rays and spines were completed during flexion (9.2 mm TL). Newly hatched larvae had two distinct branched melanophores, one at the anterior part of the forehead, another behind the auditory vesicle. Preflexion larvae (up to 3.5 mm TL) also had melanophores along the ventral body midline between the anus and the notochord tip. Fairly heavy internal pigmentation occurred above the gut. The heavily pigmented pelvic fin was evident in 4.3 mm TL preflexion larvae. During late preflexion (3.5-5.5 mm TL) body proportions and pigmentation changed dramatically. Ventral pigment decreased, and the preanal body became deeper and heavily pigmented with scattered stellate melanophores. Flexion larvae had more pigmentation and were less transparent. The spinous dorsal fin became heavily pigmented during flexion. Throughout postflexion, postanal pigmentation increased, and during transformation, it spread toward the caudal fin. At 32 d, juveniles essentially had full adult coloration. Data from this study and for two species previously described facilitates larval identification for three of the 16 species in the western Atlantic. Pigmentation, pelvic fin size, and pectoral fin rays (17-18) probably are the most useful characters for identification of sergeant major larvae. They have larger more heavily pigmented pelvic fins and a more heavily pigmented spinous dorsal fin than yellowtail damselfish (Microspathodon chrysurus) and beaugregory Stegastes leucostictus. Pectoral fins of the latter two species are larger and more pigmented.},

abstract = {Population connectivity through larval dispersal is an essential parameter in models of marine population dynamics [1-3] and the optimal size and spacing of marine reserves [4-6]. However, there are remarkably few direct estimates of larval dispersal for marine organisms, and the actual birth sites of successful recruits have never been located. Here, we solve the mystery of the natal origin of clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) juveniles by mass-marking via tetracycline immersion all larvae produced in a population. In addition, we established parentage by DNA genotyping all potential adults and all new recruits arriving in the population. Although no individuals settled into the same anemone as their parents, many settled remarkably close to home. Even though this species has a 9-12 day larval duration, one-third of settled juveniles had returned to a 2 hectare natal area, with many settling <100 m from their birth site. This represents the smallest scale of dispersal known for any marine fish species with a pelagic larval phase. The degree of local retention indicates that marine reserves can provide recruitment benefits not only beyond but also within their boundaries.},

However, it remains unclear how habitat-quality fluctuations may determine the dynamics of spatially structured populations, where the effects of habitat size, quality and isolation have been customarily assessed assuming static habitats. We present the first empirical evaluation on the effects of stochastic fluctuations in primary productivity{\textemdash}a major outcome of ecosystem functions{\textemdash}on the metapopulation dynamics of a primary consumer. A unique 13-year dataset from an herbivore rodent was used to test the hypo- thesis that inter-annual variations in primary productivity determine spatiotemporal habitat occupancy patterns and colonization and extinction processes. Inter-annual variability in productivity and in the growing season phenology significantly influenced habitat colonization patterns and occupancy dynamics. These effects lead to changes in connectivity to other potentially occupied habitat patches, which then feed back into occupancy dynamics. According to the results, the dynamics of primary productivity accounted for more than 50% of the variation in occupancy probability, depending on patch size and landscape configuration. Evidence connecting primary productivity dynamics and spatiotemporal population processes has broad implications for metapopulation persistence in fluctuating and changing environments.},

abstract = {Larval dispersal is an important ecological process of great interest to conservation and the establishment of marine protected areas. Increasing numbers of studies are turning to biophysical models to simulate dispersal patterns, including in the deep-sea, but for many ecologists unassisted by a physical oceanographer, a model can present as a black box. Sensitivity testing offers a means to test the models{\textquoteright} abilities and limitations and is a starting point for all modelling efforts. The aim of this study is to illustrate a sensitivity testing process for the unassisted ecologist, through a deep-sea case study example, and demonstrate how sensitivity testing can be used to determine optimal model settings, assess model adequacy, and inform ecological interpretation of model outputs. Five input parameters are tested (timestep of particle simulator (TS), horizontal (HS) and vertical separation (VS) of release points, release frequency (RF), and temporal range (TR) of simulations) using a commonly employed pairing of models. The procedures used are relevant to all marine larval dispersal models. It is shown how the results of these tests can inform the future set up and interpretation of ecological studies in this area. For example, an optimal arrangement of release locations spanning a release area could be deduced; the increased depth range spanned in deep-sea studies may necessitate the stratification of dispersal simulations with different numbers of release locations at different depths; no fewer than 52 releases per year should be used unless biologically informed; three years of simulations chosen based on climatic extremes may provide results with 90% similarity to five years of simulation; and this model setup is not appropriate for simulating rare dispersal events. A step-by-step process, summarising advice on the sensitivity testing procedure, is provided to inform all future unassisted ecologists looking to run a larval dispersal simulation.},

abstract = {We examined the relationship between pelagic larval duration (PLD) and species range for the wrasses and damselfishes of the eastern Pacific Ocean. This region and these species are particularly appropriate for this analysis, since there is huge variation in the biogeographic range among these reef fishes, from endemics to islands a few kilometers in diameter to pan-Indo-Pacific ranges of 25000 km or more. Furthermore, this variation in range occurs between pairs of congeners. We found no correlation between the mean (or maximum) PLDs measured from daily otolith increments and biogeographic range, for either family of reef fishes, and even after restricting the analysis to species with sample sizes over 50 individuals. A pairwise comparison of congeners showed, if anything, a significant inverse relationship between larval duration and range. The correlation between mean PLD and maximum PLD was very strong, even for large sample sizes (r = 0.987), indicating that mean PLD may be a good proxy measure for maximum PLD. We conclude that, at least within this region and within the limitations of this technique, larval duration appears not to determine species range.},

abstract = {Coastal marine ecology is, quite properly, increasingly focussed on experimental tests of hypotheses about processes. These are, however, done to explain observations and patterns. It is therefore appropriate to be able to publish quantitative observations to provide the context and basis for studying mechanisms and processes. Ecologists are concerned about very different types of observations. Some areas of study are still totally dependent on observational, descriptive evidence; some depend on mensurative tests of hypotheses about patterns. Tests of hypotheses about patterns are also needed to validate casual or qualitative observations. Guide-lines for what constitutes appropriate or publishable ecological descriptions are discussed here. These recognize the experimental, hypothesis-testing nature of many descriptive studies and consider the relevance of sound logic and experimental design in the planning, collection and interpretation of observations.},

abstract = {Most adult reef fish show site fidelity thus dispersal is limited to the mobile larval stage of the fish, and effective management of such species requires an understanding of the patterns of larval dispersal. In this study, we assess larval reef fish distributions in the waters west of the Big Island of Hawai{\textquoteleft}i using both in situ and model data. Catches from Cobb midwater trawls off west Hawai{\textquoteleft}i show that reef fish larvaeare most numerous in offshore waters deeper than 3,000 m and consist largely of pre-settlement Pomacanthids, Acanthurids and Chaetodontids. Utilizing a Lagrangian larval dispersal model, we were able to replicate the observed shore fish distributions from the trawl data and we identified the 100 m depth strata as the most likely depth of occupancy. Additionally, our model showed that for larval shore fish with a pelagic larval duration longer than 40 days there was no significant change in settlement success in our model. By creating a general additive model (GAM) incorporating lunar phase and angle we were able to explain 67.5% of the variance between modeled and in situ Acanthurid abundances. We took steps towards creating a predictive larval distribution model that will greatly aid in understanding the spatiotemporal nature of the larval pool in west Hawai{\textquoteleft}i, and the dispersal of larvae throughout the Hawaiian archipelago.},

abstract = {Variation within species is an often-overlooked aspect of community ecology, despite the fact that the ontogenetic structure of populations influences processes right up to the ecosystem level. Accounting for traits at the individual level is an important advance in the implementation of trait-based approaches in understanding community structure and function. We incorporate individual- and species-level traits into one succinct assemblage structure metric, fractional size, which is calculated as the length of an individual divided by its potential maximum length. We test the implementation of fractional size in demersal fish assemblages along a depth gradient in the deep sea. We use data from an extensive trawl survey at depths of 300-2030~m on the continental slope of the Rockall Trough, Northeast Atlantic, to compare changes in fractional size structure along an environmental gradient to those seen using traditional taxonomic and trait-based approaches. The relationship between fractional size and depth was particularly strong, with the overall pattern being an increase with depth, implying that individuals move deeper as they grow. Body size increased with depth at the intraspecific and assemblage levels. Fractional size, size structure and species composition all varied among assemblages, and this variation could be explained by the depth that the assemblage occupied. The inclusion of individual-level traits and population fractional size structure adds to our understanding at the assemblage level. Fractional size, or where an individual is in its growth trajectory, appears to be an especially important driver of assemblage change with depth. This has implications for understanding fisheries impacts in the deep sea and how these impacts may propagate across depths.},

Mathematics has been less intrusive in the life sciences, possibly because they have until recently been largely descriptive, lacking the invariance principles and fundamental natural constants of physics.

abstract = {Quantifying larval retention and connectivity remains a major hurdle in the development of realistic spatially-explicit population models in marine systems. This lack of knowledge is primarily due to the difficulty of conducting mark-recapture studies in species that are characterized by the production of large numbers of small pelagic offspring that suffer high initial mortality rates. Advances in artificial and natural tagging methodologies have, however, significantly increased the ability of marine ecologists to track larvae throughout the pelagic larval phase and subsequent recruitment into benthic populations. Many of these empirical approaches are now possible with the development of DNA sequencing and mass spectrometric instrumentation in the last decade. The presence of artificial tags in recaptured individuals remains the only unequivocal method for marking marine larvae. However, the difficulties of tagging sufficient numbers of larvae, with negligible handling effects, are formidable. Natural tags, including genetic markers and geochemical signatures in calcified tissues, are rarely unique indicators of source location, but have a significant advantage because all larvae released from an area are indelibly tagged, Given the strengths and limitations of the techniques, an approach that combines two or more techniques will likely be necessary to quantify larval retention and connectivity over appropriate spatio-temporal scales. Where possible, such a multi-technique strategy should include both artificial and natural tags.},

abstract = {Ocean circulation models are widely used to simulate organism transport in the open sea, where challenges of directly tracking organisms across vast spatial and temporal scales are daunting. Many recent studies tout the use of {\textquoteleft}high-resolution{\textquoteright} models, which are forced with atmospheric data on the scale of several hours and integrated with a time step of several minutes or seconds. However, in many cases, the model's outputs that are used to simulate organism movement have been averaged to considerably coarser resolutions (e.g. monthly mean velocity fields). To examine the sensitivity of tracking results to ocean circulation model output resolution, we took the native model output of one of the most sophisticated ocean circulation models available, the Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, and averaged it to commonly implemented spatial and temporal resolutions in studies of basin-scale dispersal. Comparisons between simulated particle trajectories and in situ near-surface drifter trajectories indicated that {\textquoteleft}over averaging{\textquoteright} model output yields predictions inconsistent with observations. Further analyses focused on the dispersal of juvenile sea turtles indicate that very different inferences regarding the pelagic ecology of these animals are obtained depending on the resolution of model output. We conclude that physical processes occurring at the scale of days and tens of kilometres should be preserved in ocean circulation model output to realistically depict the movement marine organisms and the resulting ecological and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that pelagic larval duration (PLD) influences range size in marine species with a benthic adult stage and a pelagic larval period is intuitively attractive; yet, studies conducted to date have failed to support it. A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the effect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no effect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that reef fish larvae have excellent sustained swimming capabilities and considerable potential for modifying their dispersal patterns by active swimming. However, these studies concentrate solely on the late pelagic phase. We examined the development of swimming abilities from hatching through to settlement in 3 reef fish species (Pomacentrus amboinensis, Sphaeramia nematoptera, Amphiprion melanopus). Larval rearing provided larvae at all stages of development. Experiments were conducted in flow chambers designed for measuring the critical and sustained swimming capability of young larvae. In all 3 species, critical swimming ability increased steadily with age, size, relative propulsive area and developmental stage of the larvae. In contrast, sustained swimming ability showed a marked inflection during development. Differences among species throughout development appear to reflect variations in the developmental patterns of the 3 species. Propulsive area was highly correlated with swimming ability and may prove useful for estimating swimming capabilities among species. The results suggest that some species have the potential to actively modify their dispersal patterns from an early age.},

We tested the independent and inter- active effects of habitat number (number of suitable habitats per unit area) and habitat proximity (dis- tance between these habitats) on assemblages of invertebrates associated with kelp holdfasts (Ecklo- nia radiata). We tested whether these kinds of habitat modifications have disproportionate effects on rare taxa. Loss and fragmentation of habitat did not operate independently. Patterns of diversity re- sponded markedly to decreases in number of habitats, but this effect was reduced when neighbouring habitats were proximate rather than distant. Rare rather than common taxa primarily responded to these varying aspects of fragmentation. Results highlight the importance of considering the number of suitable habitats in an area (habitat number) when testing the influence of their isolation (habitat prox- imity) on biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Awareness that number and proximity of patches are not independent at local scales may provide insights needed to predict the effects of habitat fragmen- tation on biodiversity, particularly on components of assemblages that tend to be rare.},

abstract = {The ability to learn about the spatial environment plays an important role in navigation, migration, dispersal, and foraging. However, our understanding of both the role of cognition in the development of navigation strategies and the mechanisms underlying these strategies is limited. We tested the hypothesis that complex navigation is facilitated by spatial memory in a population of Chrysemys picta that navigate with extreme precision ({\textpm}3.5 m) using specific routes that must be learned prior to age three. We used scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to manipulate the cognitive spatial abilities of free-living turtles during naturally occurring overland movements. Experienced adults treated with scopolamine diverted markedly from their precise navigation routes. Naive juveniles lacking experience (and memory) were not affected by scopolamine, and thereby served as controls for perceptual or non-spatial cognitive processes associated with navigation. Further, neither adult nor juvenile movement was affected by methylscopolamine, a form of scopolamine that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, a control for the peripheral effects of scopolamine. Together, these results are consistent with a role of spatial cognition in complex navigation and highlight a cellular mechanism that might underlie spatial cognition. Overall, our findings expand our understanding of the development of complex cognitive abilities of vertebrates and the neurological mechanisms of navigation.},

abstract = {The persistence and resilience of many coral reef species are dependent on rates of connectivity among sub-populations. However, despite increasing research efforts, the spatial scale of larval dispersal remains unpredictable for most marine metapopulations. Here, we assess patterns of larval dispersal in the angelfish Centropyge bicolor in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, using parentage and sibling reconstruction analyses based on 23 microsatellite DNA loci. We found that, contrary to previous findings in this system, self-recruitment (SR) was virtually absent at both the reef (0.4{\textendash}0.5% at 0.15 km2) and the lagoon scale (0.6{\textendash}0.8% at approx. 700 km2). While approximately 25% of the collected juveniles were identified as potential siblings, the majority of sibling pairs were sampled from separate reefs. Integrating our findings with earlier research from the same system suggests that geographical setting and life-history traits alone are not suitable predictors of SR and that high levels of localized recruitment are not universal in coral reef fishes.},

abstract = {From 1979 to 1989, global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of many meteorological variables important in baroclinic storms have been bandpass filtered to highlight fluctuations on 2- to 8-day time scales in order to illuminate the relationships among the variables in baroclinic storm-track regions. Because of the greater zonal symmetry in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) versus the Northern Hemisphere (NH), it is possible to examine these relationships over a zonal sector without being dominated by local effects associated with jet stream entrance and "it regions of the storm tracks. The bandpassed variance of geopotential height is used to define the storm track, and its meridional profile has a pronounced midlatitude maximum in the SH. The locations of the jet stream and the variance maxima of meridional and zonal velocity components, vorticity, vertical motion, specific humidity, and temperature all bear a distinctive relationship to the storm track, but the latitudes of their maxima are displaced from the center of the storm track. Many covariance quantities such as the transient eddy temperature, moisture, vorticity, and vertical and horizontal momentum fluxes also exhibit a strong storm-track signature. The observed relationships among the eddy quantities can generally be understood in terms of geostrophic theory and perturbation analysis applied to baroclinic systems. Storm-track activity is remarkably persistent throughout the year in both location and intensity in the SH. The storm track is farthest poleward in the transition seasons as part of a semiannual cycle, but remains near 50-degrees-S year round, and is strongest in the southern Indian Ocean and weakest in the South Pacific. There is a strong relationship between the storm track and the major tropospheric polar jet stream and its associated lower-level baroclinicity throughout the year, and the distribution of storm-track activity can be accounted for by baroclinic theory. In contrast to the NH, strongest meridional temperature gradients in middle latitudes are found in the summer half-year in the SH. Whereas the NH storm-track activity is much weaker in summer and shifts poleward, the SH activity is as strong as in winter and, if anything, shifts slightly equatorward. The zonal symmetry is greater in summer and meridional profiles are sharper, implying less variability in the storm track both within and between seasons. In winter, high-frequency storm-track activity extends over a broader range of latitudes and continues to be mainly associated with the polar jet stream. The question of the impact of the storm-track eddies on the mean flow is examined using zonal mean and a localized Eliassen-Palm flux. Baroclinic effects from the poleward heat flux dominate in winter and the eddies act to decelerate the upper tropospheric westerlies. Barotropic effects in the upper troposphere, mostly from the meridional momentum flux convergence, help to maintain the mean westerly distribution by accelerating the main polar jet and maintaining the mean split in the flow near New Zealand in both summer and winter and even dominate the baroclinic component in the storm track in summer. Diabatic heating by the eddies may also help maintain the mean flow.},

abstract = {Measuring connectivity in marine populations is a key, yet poorly understood issue. The degree of connectivity determines the spatial scales over which population dynamics operate, the spatial scales over which  sheries should be managed and how marine protected areas should be designed and implemented. Thus, much research is directed towards a better understanding of connectivity. The tools currently used to measure connectivity broadly include larval distribution, numerical models (physical or biophysical), genetic techniques and otolith chemistry. However, few studies use more than one of these approaches, and users of connectivity estimates are frequently unclear about what any approach actually measures or whether it is the best approach for their purposes. That is, does the tool provide information on evolutionary connectivity or ecological connectivity, can it forecast connectivity, what do the results of such studies mean in that context, and what are the limitations of the tool? This review provides an overview of these four approaches to estimating connectivity and how they work, examines what each actually measures, outlines the spatial and temporal scales over which each is appropriate and details the pros and cons of each. A historical approach is used to describe the development of these four approaches, focusing on examples using reef  shes. However, the key points are broadly applicable to marine and estuarine  shes and some invertebrates. Finally, we discuss the advantages of using multiple methods to elu- cidate a more complete understanding of marine connectivity.

abstract = {Current speed often varies with depth, so vertical movements of larvae are expected to have profound effects on dispersal velocity and therefore dispersal potential. Systematic behaviours are expected to have strong effects on dispersal. However, reliable information on the presence of vertical migrations in larvae is scarce, but the few well investigated empirical examples justify a detailed simulation study and an analysis of potential effects. We present a spatially explicit 3D hydrodynamic model that incorporates biological information in the form of active particles advected in a Lagrangian fashion. The set-up is designed to analyze the sensitivity of dispersal distances to variation in vertical behaviour of larvae. We simulated short (4 days) pelagic larval durations (PLDs) to determine whether behaviour might be important over short dispersal periods. We found that sinusoidal behaviours (slow vertical migration) in or out of phase with tides did not significantly change the dispersal patterns compared to those of larvae that remained at the surface. By contrast, a quadratic pattern of behaviour resulting in rapid vertical migration, in or out of phase with tides, had dramatic effects on both distance and direction of dispersal. The resulting dispersal kernels were found to be multimodal due to the interaction between tidal and meteorological components in flow. Incorporating biological information on larval migrations in Lagrangian simulation of dispersal will be important in estimates of connectivity and forecasting marine reserve networks.},

Though many systems have been lost and destroyed, for systems that remain physically intact, there is debate as to whether changing temperatures will result in shifts or collapses. Wernburg et al. show that extreme warming of a temperate kelp forest off Australia resulted not only in its collapse, but also in a shift in community composition that brought about an increase in herbivorous tropical fishes that prevent the reestablishment of kelp. Thus, many systems may not be resilient to the rapid climate change that we face. Science , this issue p. [169][1] [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aad8745},

abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

abstract = {The morphology and ultrastructure of the otolith settlement-mark was examined in 44 tropical reef-fish species spanning nine families. A classification scheme based on similar otolith characteristics is presented. Three major categories are identified based on changes in increment width and optical qualities of the settlement-mark. Of the 44 species examined, 39 possessed "abrupt" settlement-marks (Type I) characterised by a rapid decrease in increment width (up to 50% reduction) over settlement. Type I settlement-marks were found in all nine families examined. The 39 species spanned the whole range of possible larval durations (Pomacentrus moluccensis, 15 d +/- 0 SE; Naso hexacanthus, 91.2 d +/- 2.97 SE). Four of the 44 species possessed "zonal" settlement-marks (Type II), featuring a band of increments that are wider than pre-settlement increments. Species in this category are the labrids Coris aygula, Thalassoma bifasciatum, T. lunare and an unidentified acanthurid (Acanthurus sp. 2). One species of acanthurid (N. brevirostris) possessed a "gradual" settlement-mark (Type III), manifest as a gradual decrease in increment width during the settlement period. A possible fourth type was identified from the literature. Gnatholepis thompsoni and Coryphopterus glaucofraenum possessed a settlement-mark with increment widths that increased post-settlement. Available data suggest a poor relationship between the structure of the settlement-mark and the magnitude of metamorphosis (previously reported as internal and external morphological change). Evidence suggests that the increment profile over early development and the increment transitions associated with the settlement event are taxon-specific and may enable late-larval stage fishes to be identified to species level.},

abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into {\&}apos;those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it{\&}apos;. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an {\&}apos;all-statement{\&}apos;, referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept {\&}apos;pseudoreplication{\&}apos; amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

abstract = {Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval dispersal distances are less than his- torically assumed. Gene flow across these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal among intermediate {\textquoteleft}stepping-stone{\textquoteright} populations in combination with long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18 tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species. Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal pathways.},

abstract = {A commercially valuable trap fishery for spiny lobster (Panulirus marginatus) has existed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands since the late 1970s. Fisheries landings and research trapping show that spawning biomass and recruitment to the fishery collapsed in 1990 in the northern portion of the fishing ground and that there has been no recovery to the present, although recruitment remained strong at banks 670 km to the southeast. An advection-diffusion model is used to investigate larval transport dynamics between these two regions. The movement model is driven by geostrophic currents computed every 10 days from sea surface height obtained from TOPEX-POSEIDON satellite altimetry. The larval transport simulations indicate that even though larvae have a pelagic period of 12 months, banks differ substantially in the proportion of larvae they retain from resident spawners as well as the proportion of larvae they receive from other banks. In particular, recruitment to the northern portion of the fishing grounds is weak due to a very low local spawning biomass and a very limited contribution of larvae from the area of strong recruitment and high spawning biomass in the southeast. The results also suggest that satellite altimetry can provide useful information on physical dynamics for recruitment studies.},

All concentrations were expressed in mmol m-3 of nitrogen, and a conceptual 100 m water column was considered closed at top and bottom. The method was tested first with model output, then applied to quasi-steady-state distributions of chlorophyll a and nitrate concentrations observed in the Celtic Sea on July 7, 1982. Values of K(z) in the simulated system were set at 30 m2 day-1 above and below the thermocline. Estimates for the Celtic Sea were higher near the surface, lower just above the thermocline, and similar at depth. The model value within the thermocline was 0.2m2 day-1, whereas the estimate for the Celtic Sea was approximately 3 m2 day-1. Finally, equations were modified to allow for non-steady-state conditions noted during an upwelling period in the Tasman Sea between July 10 and July 11, 1987, one tidal cycle apart. The estimated value of K(z) approached 4700 m2 day-1 at 65 m.},

abstract = {The use of marine protected area (MPA) networks to sustain fisheries and conserve biodiversity is predicated on two critical yet rarely tested assumptions. Individual MPAs must produce sufficient larvae that settle within that reserve's boundaries to maintain local populations while simultaneously supplying larvae to other MPA nodes in the network that might otherwise suffer local extinction. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to demonstrate that patterns of self-recruitment of two reef fishes (Amphiprion percula and Chaetodon vagabundus) in an MPA in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were remarkably consistent over several years. However, dispersal from this reserve to two other nodes in an MPA network varied between species and through time. The stability of our estimates of self-recruitment suggests that even small MPAs may be self-sustaining. However, our results caution against applying optimization strategies to MPA network design without accounting for variable connectivity among species and over time.},

abstract = {The habitat associations of species are vital in determining an organism's vulnerability to environmental and anthropogenic stress. In the marine environment, post-settlement processes such as ontogenetic shifts in habitat use can affect this vulnerability by subjecting a species to differing biological and environmental conditions at various life stages. This study documents the habitat associations of adult and juvenile butterflyfishes on an inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to investigate if ontogenetic shifts in habitat use occur, and if such shifts relate to the trophic ecologies of species. Coral-feeding species displayed highly concordant distributions among adults and juveniles. In contrast, adults and juveniles of species with wider dietary selectivities (generalists) displayed significantly different distributions across reef zones. Juvenile generalist feeders were limited to the shallow, patchy areas of the reef flat whilst adult conspecifics displayed comparatively wide distributions. Butterflyfishes with a heavy reliance on corals for food appear to settle preferentially in areas with high abundances of adult conspecifics, which may partially explain why coral specialists are more vulnerable to localized depletion events. In contrast, generalist species utilize distinct habitats as adults and juveniles, suggesting that generalist butterflyfishes expand their ranges and are therefore subjected to changing environmental conditions as they reach adulthood.},

abstract = {During the day, we used settlement-stage reef-fish larvae from light-traps to study in situ orientation, 100 to 1000 m from coral reefs in water 10 to 40 m deep, at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Seven species were observed off leeward Lizard Island, and 4 species off the windward side. All but 1 species swam faster than average ambient currents. Depending on area, time, and species, 80 to 100% of larvae swam directionally. Two species of butterflyfishes Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon aureofasciatus swam away from the island, indicating that they could detect the island's reefs. Swimming of 4 species of damselfishes Chromis atripectoralis, Chrysiptera rollandi, Neopomacentrus cyanomos and Pomacentrus lepidogenys ranged from highly directional to non-directional Only in N. cyanomos did swimming direction differ between windward and leeward areas. Three species (C. atripectoralis, N. cyanornos and P. lepidogenys) were observed in morning and late afternoon at the leeward area, and all swam in a more westerly direction in the late afternoon. In the afternoon, C. atripectoralis larvae were highly directional in sunny conditions, but non-directional and individually more variable in cloudy conditions. All these observations imply that damselfish larvae utilized a solar compass. Caesio cuning and P. lepidogenys were non-directional overall, but their swimming direction differed with distance from the reef, implying the reef was detected by these species. Larvae of different species of reef fishes have differing orientations and apparently use different cues for orientation while in open, pelagic waters. Current direction did not influence swimming direction. Net movement by larvae of 6 of the 7 species differed from that of currents in either direction or speed, demonstrating that larval behaviour can result in non-passive dispersal, at least near the end of the pelagic phase.},

abstract = {Application of an individual-based particle tracking model to the migration of tropical fish larvae along the continental shelf between the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and Rottnest Island (Western Australia) has shown that there is potential for the southwards advection of passive particles/larvae in the Leeuwin Current system throughout the year. However, seasonal variations in the prevailing wind field result in corresponding seasonal changes in the surface current flow (both alongshore and cross-shelf) on the continental shelf, leading to a pulse of modelled particles arriving at Rottnest Island during the autumn months. This matches, within a month, the observed April/May peak in annual recruitment of 2 species of damselfish (Abudefduf sexfasciatus and A. vaigiensis), at the time when the Leeuwin Current is strengthening. It is assumed that the larvae are in the uppermost 20 m of the water column and that there are no vertical diurnal movements. The model has a 10 km grid spacing, and so can resolve some of the current gradients across the continental shelf. Comparison of the modelled near-surface currents with ADCP measurements at 2 current mooring sites as well as with a broader range of historical current measurements off southwestern Australia indicates that the alongshore net transport is reasonably well reproduced by the model, whereas agreement with the cross-shelf flow is not as good (this may be partly attributed to the paucity of high-quality near-surface current measurements in the area of study). Because of limitations in our knowledge of the swimming ability, choice of swimming direction and habitat selection of larval fish, as well as the inability of the model to reproduce the small-scale circulation around Rottnest Island, the swimming capacity of the late-stage larval fish is not specifically included; they are considered as potential settlers once they have reached within 20 km of the Island. The observed inter-annual variability in recruitment is not as well matched by the model as is the seasonal pattern, but this is almost certainly due to uncertainties in biological factors such as spawning strength, food and predation en route, which are not known. The modelled results are also applied to a more general discussion of the transport of eggs and larvae of commercial fish and invertebrate species on the Western Australian continental shelf, and it is shown that the seasonality and position on the shelf of the spawning may play a large role in the movement (and hence survival and ultimate recruitment) of different species.

Here, we explore how reproductive schedule and larval behavior affect how much connectivity fluctuations depress growth. We combine larval dispersal simulations from the Florida Keys with theoretical results to calculate the effect of fluctuations on bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). We find that fluctuations depress growth only slightly (∼2%), but the effect would be much stronger for an organism that spawned only part of the year. Larval behavior can also matter, as vertical migration allows larvae to become entrained in eddies. Eddies synchronize connectivity fluctuations, further decreasing growth. However, here, they also divide the Keys into largely independently fluctuating regions, mitigating the effects of local synchrony. Therefore, in situations where connectivity fluctuations matter, the presence of independently fluctuatin...},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has emerged during the past 5 y as an alternative approach to single-species fishery management. To date, policy development has generally outstripped application and implementation. The EBFM approach has been broadly adopted at a policy level within Australia through a variety of instruments including fisheries legislation, environmental legislation, and a national policy on integrated oceans management. The speed of policy adoption has necessitated equally rapid development of scientific and management tools to support practical implementation. We discuss some of the scientific tools that have been developed to meet this need. These tools include extension of the management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach to evaluate broader ecosystem-based fishery management strategies (using the Atlantis modelling framework), development of new approaches to ecological risk assessment (ERA) for evaluating the ecological impacts of fishing, and development of a harvest strategy framework (HSF) and policy that forms the basis for a broader EBFM strategy. The practical application of these tools (MSE, ERA, and HSF) is illustrated for the southern and eastern fisheries of Australia.},

title = {{In order to better understand ecosystem functioning under simultaneous pressures (e.g. both climate change and fishing pressures), integrated modelling approaches are advocated. We developed an end-to-end model of the southern Benguela ecosystem by coupling the high trophic level model OSMOSE with a biophysical model (ROMS-N2P2Z2D2). OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies, individual-based model simulating the whole life cycle of fish with fish schools interacting through opportunistic and size-based predation. It is linked to the biogeochemical model through the predation process; plankton groups are food for fish and fish apply a predation mortality on plankton. Here we describe the two-way coupling between the models and follow a pattern-oriented modelling approach to validate the simulations. At the individual level, model outputs are consistent with observed diets for several species from small pelagic fish to top predatory fish, although biases emerge from underestimation of macrozooplankton and lack of vertical structure. At the population level, the seasonality of the size structure is similar between the model and data. At the community level, the modelled trophic structure is consistent with the knowledge available for this ecosystem. The structure of the foodweb is an emergent property of the model, showing trophic links between species, their strength and the strong connectivity observed. We also highlight the capacity of this model for tracking indicators at various hierarchical levels.

abstract = {Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This "representation" objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.},

abstract = {Recently researchers have gone to great lengths to measure marine metapopulation connectivity via tagging, genetic, and trace-elemental fingerprinting studies. These empirical estimates of larval dispersal are key to assessing the significance of metapopulation connectivity within a demographic context, but the life-history data required to do this are rarely available. To evaluate the demographic consequences of connectivity we constructed seasonal, size-structured metapopulation matrix models for two species of mytilid mussel in San Diego County, California, USA. The self-recruitment and larval exchange terms were produced from a time series of realized connectivities derived from trace-elemental fingerprinting of larval shells during spring and fall from 2003 to 2008. Both species exhibited a strong seasonal pattern of southward movement of recruits in spring and northward movement in fall. Growth and mortality terms were estimated using mark{\textendash}recapture data from representative sites for each species and subpopulation, and literature estimates of juvenile mortality. Fecundity terms were estimated using county-wide settlement data from 2006{\textendash}2008; these data reveal peak reproduction and recruitment in fall for Mytilus californianus, and spring for M. galloprovincialis. Elasticity and life-stage simulation analyses were employed to identify the season- and subpopulation-specific vital rates and connectivity terms to which the metapopulation growth rate (k) was most sensitive. For both species, metapopulation growth was most sensitive to proportional changes in adult fecundity, survival and growth of juvenile stages, and population connectivity, in order of importance, but relatively insensitive to adult growth or survival. The metapopulation concept was deemed appropriate for both Mytilus species as exchange between the subpopulations was necessary for subpopulation persistence. However, highest metapopulation growth occurred in years when a greater proportion of recruits was retained within the predominant source subpopulation. Despite differences in habitat and planktonic duration, both species exhibited similar overall metapopulation dynamics with respect to key life stages and processes. However, different peak reproductive periods in an environment of seasonal current reversals led to different regional (subpopulation) contributions to metapopulation maintenance; this result emphasizes the importance of connectivity analysis for spatial management of coastal resources.

abstract = {A pelagic larval stage is found in nearly all demersal marine teleost fishes, and it is during this pelagic stage that the geographic scale of dispersal is determined. Marine biologists have long made a simplifying assumption that behaviour of larvae-with the possible exception of vertical distribution-has negligible influence on larval dispersal. Because advection by currents can take place over huge scales during a pelagic larval stage that typically lasts for several days to several weeks, this simplifying assumption leads to the conclusion that populations of marine demersal fishes operate over, and are connected over, similar huge scales. This conclusion has major implications for our perception of how marine fish populations operate and for our management of them. Recent (and some older) behavioural research-reviewed here-reveals that for a substantial portion of the pelagic larval stage of perciform fishes, the simplifying assumption is invalid. Near settlement, and for a considerable portion of the pelagic stage prior to that, larvae of many fish species are capable of swimming at speeds faster than mean ambient currents over long periods, travelling tens of kilometres. Only the smallest larvae of perciform fishes swim in at energetically costly viscous hydrodynamic environment (i.e., low Reynolds number). Vertical distribution is under strong behavioural control from the time of hatching, if not before, and call have a decisive, if indirect, influence on dispersal trajectories. Larvae of some species avoid currents by occupying the epibenthic boundary layer. Larvae are able to swim directionally in the pelagic environment, with some species apparently orientating relative to the suit and others to settlement sites. These abilities develop relatively early, and ontogenetic changes in orientation are seemingly common. Larvae of some species call use sound to navigate, and others can use odour to find settlement habitat, at least over small scales. Other senses may also be important to orientation. Larvae are highly aware of their environment and of potential predators, and some school during the pelagic larval stage. Larvae are selective about where they settle at both meso and micro scales, and settlement is strongly influenced by interactions with resident fishes. Most of these behaviours are flexible; for example, swimming speeds and depth may vary among locations, and speed may vary with swimming direction. In direct tests, these behaviours result in dispersal different from that predicted by currents alone. Work with both tropical and temperate species shows that these behaviours begin to be significant relatively early in larval development, but much more needs to be learned about the ontogeny of behaviour and sensory abilities in larvae of marine fishes. As a preliminary rule of thumb, behaviour must be taken into account in considerations of dispersal after the preflexion stage, and vertical distribution behaviour call influence dispersal from hatching. Larvae of perciform fishes are close to being planktonic at the start of the pelagic period and are clearly nektonic at its end, and for a substantial period prior to that. All these things differ among species. Larvae of clupeiform, gadiform and pleuronectiform fishes may be less capable behaviourally than perciform fishes, but this remains to be confirmed. Clearly, these behaviours, along with hydrography, must be included in modelling dispersal and retention and may provide explanations for recent demonstrations of set-recruitment in marine fish populations. Current wrk is directed at understanding the ontogeny of the gradual transition from planktonic to nektonic behaviour. Although it is clear that larvae of perciform fishes have the ability to strongly influence their dispersal trajectories, it is less clear whether or how these abilities are applied.},

abstract = {Patterns of climate-forced range shift in the marine environment are informed by investigating the population dynamics of an ecologically important sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii-Diadematidae) across its newly extended range in Tasmania (southeastern Australia). A growth model of C. rodgersii is developed allowing estimation of a sea urchin age profile and, in combination with abundance data, we correlate the sea urchin population dynamic with respect to environmental signals across the range extension region. Growth patterns did not vary across the extension region; however, there was a strong pattern of decreasing sea urchin age with increasing distance from the historic range. The sequential poleward discovery of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general poleward reduction in abundance along the eastern Tasmanian coastline are consistent with a model of range extension driven by recent change in patterns of larval dispersal. We explore this hypothesis by correlating C. rodgersii population characteristics with respect to the East Australian Current (EAC), i.e. the chief vector for poleward larval dispersal, and reveal patterns of declining sea urchin age and abundance with increasing distance from this oceanic feature. Furthermore, C. rodgersii is generally limited to sites where average winter temperatures are warmer than the cold threshold for its larval development. Potential dispersal and physiological mechanisms defining the range extension appear to be strongly coupled to the EAC which has undergone recent poleward advance and resulted in coastal warming in eastern Tasmania. Predicted climate change conditions for this region will favour continued population expansion of C. rodgersii not only via atmospheric-forced ocean warming, but also via ongoing intensification of the EAC driving continued poleward supply of larvae and heat. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Larvae have been difficult to study because their small size limits our ability to understand their behavior and the conditions they experience. Questions about larval transport focus largely on (a) where they go [dispersal] and (b) where they come from [connectivity]. Mechanisms of transport have been intensively studied in recent decades. As our ability to identify larval sources develops, the consequences of connectivity are garnering more consideration. Attention to transport and connectivity issues has increased dramatically in the past decade, fueled by changing motivations that now include management of fisheries resources, understanding of the spread of invasive species, conservation through the design of marine reserves, and prediction of climate-change effects. Current progress involves both technological advances and the integration of disciplines and approaches. This review focuses on insights gained from physical modeling, chemical tracking, and genetic approaches. I consider how new findings are motivating paradigm shifts concerning (1) life-history consequences; (2) the openness of marine populations, self-recruitment, and population connectivity; (3) the role of behavior; and (4) the significance of variability in space and time. A challenge for the future will be to integrate methods that address dispersal on short (intragenerational) timescales such as elemental fingerprinting and numerical simulations with those that reflect longer timescales such as gene flow estimates and demographic modeling. Recognition and treatment of the continuum between ecological and evolutionary timescales will be necessary to advance the mechanistic understanding of larval and population dynamics.},

abstract = {Connectivity, the demographic linking of local populations through the dispersal of individuals, is one of the most poorly understood processes in population dynamics, yet has profound implications for conservation and harvest strategies. For marine species with pelagic larvae, direct estimation of connectivity remains logistically challenging and has mostly been limited to single snapshots in time. Here, we document seasonal and interannual patterns of larval dispersal in a metapopulation of the coral reef fish Amphiprion polymnus. A 3-year record of larval trajectories within and among nine discrete local populations from an area of approximately 35~km was established by determining the natal origin of settled juveniles through DNA parentage analysis. We found that spatial patterns of both self-recruitment and connectivity were remarkably consistent over time, with a low level of self-recruitment at the scale of individual sites. Connectivity among sites was common and multidirectional in all years and was not significantly influenced by seasonal variability of predominant surface current directions. However, approximately 75% of the sampled juveniles could not be assigned to parents within the study area, indicating high levels of immigrations from sources outside the study area. The data support predictions that the magnitude and temporal stability of larval connectivity decreases significantly with increasing distance between subpopulations, but increases with the size of subpopulations. Given the considerable effort needed to directly measure larval exchange, the consistent patterns suggest snapshot parentage analyses can provide useful dispersal estimates to inform spatial management decisions.},

abstract = {Many coral reef fish larvae spend days to months in the open ocean before settlement on coral reefs [1]. Early in development, larvae have limited swimming capabilities and will therefore be greatly affected by currents. This can potentially result in dispersal distances of tens of kilometers [2]. Nevertheless, up to 60 % of surviving larvae have been shown to return to their natal reefs [2]. To home, the larvae must develop strong swimming capabilities and appropriate orientation mechanisms. Most late-stage larval reef fish can, after being passively drifted for days to weeks, swim strongly [3], and Ostorhinchus doederleini larvae have been shown to use chemotaxis to identify their natal reef once in its vicinity [2] and a sun compass for longer distance orientation [4] during the day. But how do they orient at night? Here, we show that newly settled fish caught at One Tree Island (OTI) at the Capricorn Bunker Reef Group (Great Barrier Reef) can use geomagnetic compass information to keep a south-east heading. This behavior might help them return to their natal reef in the absence of any celestial cues at night.},

abstract = {Connectivity throughout the life cycle of flatfish remains an open question, especially during the early life stages. Their effective management requires understanding of how spawning grounds and nurseries are connected and what processes influence larval retention and dispersal. The case of sole (Solea solea L.) is of particular interest because it is one of the most valuable commercial species in the North Sea, although stocks are chronically overexploited and variability in interannual recruitment is high. The transport of sole larvae from the spawning grounds to the nurseries is driven by hydrodynamic processes, but the final dispersal pattern and larval survival/abundance might be influenced by both behavioral and environmental factors. Therefore it is important to understand the relative impact of hydrodynamics, environment, behavior and ecophysiology on sole larval dispersal. Here we use a particle-tracking transport model coupled to a 3D hydro-dynamic model of the North Sea to investigate interannual variability of the transport of sole larvae over a 12-year period (1995{\textendash}2006). A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative impact of hydro- dynamics, temperature and behavior on the recruitment dynamics to the nurseries. Four scenarios have been tested: (i) constant forcing of sea surface temperature during all years but varying meteorological forcing and river runoff, (ii) constant meteorological forcing during the whole period but varying sea surface temperature and river runoff, (iii) no vertical migration and (iv) an extended drift period (max. 30 days) before settle- ment if the larvae are not close to a suitable sediment type. Results suggest that year-to-year variability of larval supply to the nurseries is high, both in terms of abundance and larval source (balance between reten- tion and dispersal). Sensitivity analysis shows that larval abundance at the end of the larval stage increases considerably if a settling delay is included. The impact of vertical migration on larval transport and the variations in larval retention at the nurseries due to varying meteorological conditions and sea sur- face temperature forcing are not spatially consistent.},

abstract = {To date, there are numerous transport simulation studies demonstrating the relevance of the hydrodynamics for the advection, dispersion and recruitment of early stages of marine organisms. However, the lack of data has conditioned the use of realistic locations for the model setup and configuration in transport studies. This work (I) demonstrates the key role played by the use of the realistic initial position of the eggs of small pelagic fishes in the analysis of late-larval recruitment in coastal nursery areas and (II) provides a general solution for deriving future egg positions and abundances from adult biomass obtained from acoustic surveys and available fecundity data. Using European anchovy in the NW Mediterranean as a case study, we first analyzed the impact of the initial location, timing, egg buoyancy and diel vertical migration of larvae on the potential late-larval recruitment to coastal areas. The results suggested that prior knowledge of the initial spawning grounds may substantially affect the estimates of potential recruitment. We then integrated biological and acoustics-derived data (the biomass and size structure, sex ratio, a weight-batch fecundity model, mean weight, number of fish and mean spawning) to build a predictive model for interannual egg production. This model was satisfactorily contrasted with field data for two years obtained with the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM). We discuss our results in the context of the fluctuations of European anchovy egg abundance from 2003 through 2010 in the NW Mediterranean and in terms of the potential applicability of the acoustics-based spatial predictive egg production model.},

abstract = {Annual publications involving the application of coupled physical-biological models for understanding fish recruitment processes have increased over the last decade. Sixty-nine papers were reviewed to assess the contribution these models have made to recruitment prediction and understanding. The majority of models reviewed were 2- and 3-dimensional numerical simulation models, although a limited number of I-dimensional analytical models were included. Most models used a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to advect and diffuse particles within the model domain. The vertical and horizontal resolutions and temporal durations of the models varied widely. This review identified 3 categories of papers: explanatory, inferential and hypothesis generating. Reviewed papers were dominated by explanatory approaches. Assessment of the sensitivity of model predictions to the model parameters were rare, but not entirely absent in this group of papers. Inferential approaches were the next most common, and sought to infer the presence or role of a particular mechanism. Hypothesis-generating publications were the rarest, but perhaps have the most to contribute to a greater understanding of recruitment processes. An increase in the frequency of hypothesis-generating applications of coupled physical-biological models may be expected over time as the field matures and refinements to both the physical and biological processes included in the models are made.},

abstract = {I present dispersal distances for 44 species with data on propagule duration (PD) for 40 of these. Data were combined with those in Shanks et al. (2003; Ecol. Appl. 13: S159-S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than 1 day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs (<1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.},

abstract = {Artificial creation of shallows, including tidal flats and the establishment of sanctuary, is necessary to restore decreasing resources of the bivalves and their related water purification function. Therefore, it is important to choose areas that will be the most effective for the recruitment and/or supply of pelagic larvae. We selected the short-necked clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) as a target species, and observed vertical distribution of the larvae. Using a receptor mode model, we tried to predict trajectories of the pelagic larvae towards the Isshiki tidal flat areas, where is the biggest fishery ground for short-necked clams in Mikawa Bay. The results showed the following: (1) Pelagic larvae are distributed in the mid layer at a depth of about 3 m by some autonomous behavior; (2) Relatively stable amount of biomass in the Isshiki tidal flat areas depends on multiple larval supply sources; (3) Sources of supply vary greatly with temporal wind-induced currents; (4) Main sources of larvae supplied to the Isshiki tidal flat areas exist at the inner part of the bay, so there is a great possibility that the larval supply might have been greatly damaged by extensive coastal reclamation in the past, and by the hypoxic conditions in recent years; and (5) Artificial shallows should be constructed at the inner-part of Mikawa Bay so that the small shallows, still in existence at the inner part of the bay, will become more important. The receptor mode model used in this study has been useful in solving some of the difficult problems faced in restoring bay environment, such as, "where is the best location to site artificial shallows and/or protected areas?"},

abstract = {Aquatic life exists between very small passive floating objects such as spores, eggs or seeds which are at the mercy of currents through to animals which swim powerfully enough to overcome most natural currents. There is a corresponding scale of cognitive and sensory capability. Coupling hydrodynamic with Lagrangian particle modelling is well established, as is individual based modelling of animal behaviour. These areas have developed rapidly, due to availability of faster computers. These different disciplines have fundamentally different conceptual frameworks, but the combination of techniques offers an unparalleled opportunity to model swimming animals in water more accurately. More accurate models of dispersion, migration and other spatial dynamics would support a better informed ecosystem management and provide methods to define protected areas that are linked in coherent networks. Development plans for tidal power schemes and offshore wind farms mean that predictive models of migrating fish are needed urgently. Statistical models based on correlations become inaccurate as the environments move to previously unobserved states. This is where models based on rules such as individual based models have a unique advantage. I briefly review Eulerian. Lagrangian, coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian water models, water quality models and individual based models of animal movements, navigation and interactive behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vertical distribution patterns were studied in the community of coral reef fish larvae around Tetiaroa (French Polynesia) using vertically stratified net tows within the first 100 m of the water column. These patterns were examined statistically using an approach based on the center of mass of larval patches. Regression trees first highlighted large differences between taxa, followed by an ontogenetic effect within each taxon. Many families displayed a vertical spread during ontogeny that accounted in part for a downward shift in the distribution of centers of mass. The spread suggests that, throughout ontogeny, individuals move within a wider range of depths rather than migrate downward synchronously. Both the spread and the shift were consistent at the community level despite the taxonomic differences. No difference in mean depth or spread was discernible between day and night, except for Serranidae, which were shallower at night. Environmental factors (such as thermocline depth or current shear) usually explained little variance, except for Lethrinidae and Blennidae, which were consistently deeper when the halocline was deeper. Although the overall effect of the observed ontogenetic spread in such a mildly stratified environment is likely to be small, it might still favor exceptional cases of retention, which can be important given the very low recruitment rate of coral reef fishes.},

abstract = {The warming of coastal oceans due to climate change is increasing the overwinter survival of tropical fishes transported to temperate latitudes by ocean currents. However, the processes governing early post-arrival mortality are complex and can result in minimum threshold temperatures for overwinter survival, which are greater than those predicted based upon physiological temperature tolerances alone. This 3.5 mo laboratory study monitored the early performance of a tropical damselfish Abudefduf vaigiensis that occurs commonly during austral summer along the SE Australian coast, under nominal summer and winter water temperatures, and compares results with a co-occurring year-round resident of the same family, Parma microlepis. Survivorship, feeding rate, growth and burst swimming ability (as a measure of predator escape ability) were all reduced for the tropical species at winter water temperatures compared to those in summer, whereas the temperate species experienced no mortality and only feeding rate was reduced at colder temperatures. These results suggest that observed minimum threshold survival temperatures may be greater than predicted by physiology alone, due to lowered food intake combined with increased predation risk (a longer time at vulnerable sizes and reduced escape ability). Overwinter survival is a significant hurdle in pole-ward range expansions of tropical fishes, and a better understanding of its complex processes will allow for more accurate predictions of changes in biodiversity as coastal ocean temperatures continue to increase due to climate change.},

abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect populat...},

abstract = {To study retention of waterborn larvae in a reef matrix we used a finite-element unstructured numerical model with a minimum horizontal resolution of 150 m that can capture variability of currents on a spatial scale relevant to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Areas of high reef density (i.e. closely aggregated reefs) are poorly flushed because the prevailing currents are directed around and away from these regions, which is an oceanographic process called the 'sticky water' effect. The model showed that the sticky water effect leads to decreased flushing and a high exposure time in high reef density areas in the southern and central regions of the GBR matrix. In turn this generated hot spots of high self-seeding, and these hot spots existed under both calm weather conditions and wind conditions typical of those during the coral spawning season. Away from these areas, self-seeding was less likely to occur and larval replenishment would result mainly from connectivity between reefs located kilometres to tens of kilometres apart. The location of sticky water areas varied spatially within the reef matrix according to tidal and mean currents, local bathymetry and reef density (defined as the degree of aggregation by reefs). A simple analytical formula is presented that explains similar to 70% of the variation in larval retention in both calm weather and windy conditions. Complex reef mosaics and the related sticky water effect may have significant implications on the fate of larvae, and thus on connectivity for coral reefs worldwide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Swimming speeds of the late-stage, pelagic larvae of coral-reef fishes were measured in situ near Lizard Island on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and Rangiroa Atoll, Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia during 1995-96. Larvae were captured with light traps End crest nets, and released individually in open water. They were then followed by SCUBA divers, normally for 10 min, and their speed was measured with a modified plankton-net flow meter and a stop watch. Swimming speeds of 260 larvae of 50 species in 15 families of mostly perciform reef fishes are presented. Most measurements were for pomacentrids (8 genera, 16 species, 127 individuals), apogonids (1 genus, similar to 5 species, 18 individuals), chaetodontids (3 genera, 8 species, 49 individuals), lethrinids (1 genus, similar to 4 species, 11 individuals), nemipterids (1 genus, 2 species, 10 individuals), serranids (2 genera, 2 species, 14 individuals) and acanthurids (2 genera, similar to 4 species, 13 individuals). Numbers of individuals per species ranged from 1 to 25. Speeds were remarkably high for such small fishes (0.7 to 5.5 cm). Average speed was 20.6 cm s(-1) (range 2 to 65), or 13.7 body lengths s(-1) (range 2 to 34). SE for species with n > 4 ranged from 0.8 to 5.3 cm s(-1) (4.1 to 25.0% of mean speed), but speed of the fastest individual of each species averaged 144% of mean speed. A taxonomic component was evident, with apogonids the slowest (2 to 13 cm s(-1)), followed by nemipterids (10 cm s(-1)). Speed of pomacentrids and chaetodontids varied widely among species (7 to 35 cm s(-1)), whereas acanthurids, lethrinids and serranids were fast (19 to 55 cm s(-1)). Except for apogonids and nemipterids, nearly all species had mean swimming speeds greater than average ambient current speeds in the Lizard island area. Mean speed was positively correlated with size (slope 8.2, r(2) = 0.43) when all taxa were included, but was not correlated with size for the Pomacentridae and Chaetodontidae when each were considered alone. The speeds reported here combined with data on swimming endurance recently reported by Stobutzki {\&} Bellwood (1997; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 149:35-41) reveal remarkable swimming abilities for late-stage pelagic larvae of coral-reef fishes which could either greatly enhance dispersal or eliminate it.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production (NPP). We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.},

abstract = {We describe a new technique for transgenerational marking of embryonic otoliths that promises significant advancements in the study of larval dispersal and population connectivity in marine fishes. The approach is based on maternal transmission of Ba-137 from spawning females to egg material that is ultimately incorporated into the otoliths of embryos produced by an individual after exposure to the isotope. We injected females of a benthic-spawning clownfish (Amphiprion melanopus) and a pelagic-spawning serranid (Centropristis striata) with enriched (BaCl2)-Ba-137 and then reared the resulting progeny through to settlement. Barium isotope ratios in the cores of larval otoliths were quantified using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Larval otoliths from both species contained unequivocal Ba isotope signatures over a wide range of doses (0.8-23 mu g (137)Ba(.)g female(-1)). Female A. melanopus continued to produce marked larvae over multiple clutches and for at least 90 days after a single injection. The ability to administer different combinations of stable Ba isotopes provides a new means of mass-marking larvae of benthic- and pelagic-spawning fishes from multiple populations over extended spawning periods.},

abstract = {We herein describe a long-term (22 consecutive yr, 1990 to 2011) time series of recruitment surveys for a guild of coral-sheltering fishes at 7 to 12 sites along a 26 km section of the west coast of Hawaii Island. For arc-eye hawkfish, the numerically dominant species, recruitment (defined as the contribution of young-of-year to the benthic population within several months after settlement from the water column) varied 7-fold among years averaged over sites. Nonetheless, recruitment also differed spatially, with sites along the Kohala Peninsula comprising a high recruitment group. Spatial differences were persistent (some sites predictably low, others predictably high) and generally lacked demonstrable variation over time. Complementary em - pirical data suggested that post-settlement processes (predation, interspecific competition) also affected recruitment. A dispersal model combined with currents from an oceanic circulation model (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, HYCOM) was used to simulate the spatial patterns of settlement by larvae released throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. These simulations generally agreed with observed spatial patterns of recruitment. Greater recruitment was also predicted near geomorphological features (headlands) on Hawaii Island most influenced by the flow of surface eddy currents generated by prevailing E-NE trade winds. Empirical data and simulations together suggest that the headlands of west Hawaii Island likely enhance recruitment by intercepting or concentrating larvae at greater rates, but that post-settlement processes dampen variations in settlement. We suggest that habitat geomorphology should be considered in the criteria used to select sites for no-take Marine Protected Areas at Hawaii Island {\textcopyright} 2013 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Networks of nature reserves and protected areas are important instruments to protect biodiversity, including harvested populations. Selection of marine protected networks (MPA) will depend on both the connectivity of concerned species and the habitat quality of individual sites. We explore the relative effect of connectivity and habitat quality on solutions for optimal networks of MPA using eigenvalue perturbation theory and a metapopulation model. Based on analyses of both synthetic networks and realistic connectivities for a sessile invertebrate with planktonic larvae in the Baltic Sea, we show that connectivity is expected to be more efficient than habitat quality as a selection criterion for MPA networks with realistic probabilities of local recruitment. In a second series of analyses we explore the effect of temporal variability of connectivity on the selection of optimal MPA networks. We show that optimal solutions of MPA networks converged when based on 8-10 years of connectivity information, corresponding to the time scale of the North-Atlantic oscillation. In conclusion, this study indicates that connectivity may be more important than habitat quality as selection criterion for MPAs when targeting species with long-distance dispersal that is typical for many marine invertebrates and fish. Our study also shows that connectivity patterns may be relatively consistent in time which suggests that the recent progress in biophysical modelling can offer a framework for optimal selection of MPA networks based on connectivities, which should improve guidelines for the design of functional MPA networks.

abstract = {The supply of coral reef fish larvae from the open ocean to nearshore reefs is vital for the persistence of local fish populations. Larvae that are competent to settle are often fast swimmers, and their transport to suitable settlement habitat may depend on swimming behavior as well as currents. Our goal was to measure the effects of swimming behavior during the final period of larval transport. We observed late-stage bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus larvae 1 km offshore of French Reef, Key Largo, Florida, USA, and recorded their in situ swimming trajectories. While all larvae swam remarkably straight, their swimming directions were distributed randomly. Larvae swam at speeds of 2 to 32 cm s(-1) and transport due to swimming was of similar magnitude as transport due to cross-shore current, but much less than transport due to alongshore current. We used a simulation model to generate swimming trajectories of much longer duration than would be feasible to directly observe. This enabled us to better quantify the contribution of swimming behavior to larval transport. The observed and simulated swimming trajectories indicate that horizontal swimming by larvae with or without an external reference frame is important at spatial scales of several kilometers.},

abstract = {In tropical reef ecosystems corals are the key habitat builders providing most ecosystem structure, which influences coral reef biodiversity and resilience. Remote sensing applications have progressed significantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantified. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1{\textendash}6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1% coefficient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1{\textendash}3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8% and 37%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.},

abstract = {Larval reef fish possess considerable swimming and sensory abilities, which could enable navigation towards settlement habitat from the open ocean. Due to their small size and relatively low survival, tagging individual larvae is not a viable option, but numerical modeling studies have proven useful for understanding the role of orientation throughout ontogeny. Here we combined the theoretical framework of the biased correlated random walk model with a very high resolution three-dimensional coupled biophysical model to investigate the role of orientation behavior in fish larvae. Virtual larvae of the bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) were released daily during their peak spawning period from two locations in the Florida Keys Reef Tract, a region of complex eddy fields bounded by the strong Florida Current. The larvae began orientation behavior either before or during flexion, and only larvae that were within a given maximum detection distance from the reef were allowed to orient. They were subjected to ontogenetic vertical migration, increased their swimming speed during ontogeny, and settled on reefs within a flexible window of 24 to 32 days of pelagic duration. Early orientation, as well as a large maximum detection distance, increased settlement, implying that the early use of large-scale cues increases survival. Orientation behavior also increased the number of larvae that settled near their home reef, providing evidence that orientation is a mechanism driving self-recruitment. This study demonstrates that despite the low swimming abilities of the earliest larval stages, orientation during this "critical period" would have remarkable demographic consequences.

abstract = {Statistical mechanics provides the link between microscopic properties of many-particle systems and macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature. Observations of similar {\textquotedblleft}microscopic{\textquotedblright} quantities exist for the motion of zooplankton, as well as many species of other social animals. Herein, we propose to take average squared velocities as the defini- tion of the {\textquotedblleft}ecological temperature{\textquotedblright} of a population under different conditions on nutrients, light, oxygen and others. We test the usefulness of this definition on observations of the crustacean zooplankton Daphnia pulicaria. In one set of experiments, D. pulicaria is infested with the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. We find that infested D. pulicaria under light exposure have a significantly greater ecological temperature, which puts them at a greater risk of detection by visual predators. In a second set of experiments, we observe D. pulicaria in cold and warm water, and in darkness and under light exposure. Overall, our ecological temperature is a good discriminator of the crustacean{\textquoteright}s swimming behavior.},

abstract = {Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo , Salvelinus , and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogeneti The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.},

abstract = {Coral reef fish have considerable larval behavioral capabilities that can lead to successful completion of the early pelagic life phase. In particular, vertical migration during ontogeny increases retention near natal reefs and decreases losses due to transport by currents. For those larvae that are not returning home, the relative influence of behavior (biology) and currents (physics) on their arrival pattern among adjacent and distant reefs is not known. Moreover, interactions of the naturally small-scale larval movements with those of larger-scale currents need to be evaluated with regard to the spatial patterns of recruitment. We used an offline Lagrangian stochastic modeling approach to explore the relative influence of physical (i.e. eddy perturbation, diffusion) and biological processes (i.e. vertical movement, mortality) on the connectivity of the coral reef fish population in the western Caribbean, a region with complex geomorphology and circulation. This study revealed that the impact of larval behavior extends beyond enhancing the process of self-recruitment by changing population connectivity patterns. Connectivity was significantly influenced by larval vertical movement, survival, and by the eddy field, all controlling arrival patterns near reefs. A sensitivity analysis was done to gauge the robustness of the results by varying the model parameters. We found that particle-tracking models with homogeneous parameterization of the sub-grid motion tended to bias dispersal from and along the reef track, which can be mitigated by using spatially explicit parameters calculated from the Eulerian velocity fields. Finally, larval survival emerged as a key component for connectivity estimates, the study of which poses a great challenge in tropical ecosystems.},

abstract = {Many marine species have small, pelagic early life stages. For those species, knowledge of population connectivity requires understanding the origin and trajectories of dispersing eggs and larvae among subpopulations. Researchers have used various terms to describe the movement of eggs and larvae in the marine environment, including larval dispersal, dispersion, drift, export, retention, and larval transport. Though these terms are intuitive and relevant for understanding the spatial dynamics of populations, some may be nonoperational (i.e., not measurable), and the variety of descriptors and approaches used makes studies difficult to compare. Furthermore, the assumptions that underlie some of these concepts are rarely identified and tested. Here, we describe two phenomenologically relevant concepts, larval transport and larval dispersal. These concepts have corresponding operational definitions, are relevant to understanding population connectivity, and have a long history in the literature, although they are sometimes confused and used interchangeably. After defining and discussing larval transport and dispersal, we consider the relative importance of planktonic processes to the overall understanding and measurement of population connectivity. The ideas considered in this contribution are applicable to most benthic and pelagic species that undergo transformations among life stages. In this review, however, we focus on coastal and nearshore benthic invertebrates and fishes.},
