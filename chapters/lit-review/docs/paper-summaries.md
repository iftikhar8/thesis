# Summary of read papers and internal dynamics

## Model resolution

### Local retention

TESKE 2016: Capturing near-shore processes increased local recruitment

### Self-recruitment


### Settlement success


### Dispersal distance



## Open vs Closed

### Pelagic larval duration

### Local retention
Reduced PLD increased LR: Kendall 2016.

### Self-recruitment



### Settlement success

Cetina-Heredia 2015: Longer PLDs reduced settlement (when being exposed to changing current, but not temperature):
DRAKE 2011: longer PLD reduced settlement success
BIDEGAIN 2013: Longer PLD reduced settlement success
KENDALL 2013: Longer PLD reduced settlement success

### Dispersal distance

Reduced PLD decreased DD: Kendall 2016.
Increased PLD increased DD: Wood 2016.
Climate change (increased PLD with temp) increased DD (also changes in currents): Cetina-Heredia 2015
PLD drove dispersal distance: Abesamis 2016
DRAKE2011 - increased dispersal distance
Empirically, using genetic parentage analysis it has been found no relationship between PLD and dispersal distance for the fish (Elacatinus lori): D'Aloia 2015.

## Mortality

### General

Connectivity patterns did not change with temperature dependent larval mortality for some future scenarios: Cetina-Heredia 2015

### Local retention

### Self-recruitment

### Settlement success

KENDALL 2013: Increased mortality decreased settlement success

CHASSE 2010: Fixed verses variable mortality schemes did change patterns of settlement, lowering SR and settlement success. (Variable mortality was higher).

NEO 2013: Increasing mortality reduced settlement success

### Dispersal distance

## Settlement competency

### Local retention

### Self-recruitment

### Settlement success

KENDALL 2013: Not competency, but settlement buffer increase also increases success (but not much)

### Dispersal distance

## Behaviour

### General

KOUGH 2015: Behaviour becomes more important to dispersal when spawning times are less regular.

### Local retention

KLEIN 2016: Staying deeper increased local retention
Ewers‚ÄêSaucedo 2016: Release at depth increased LR.
MOKSNES 2014: Behaviour also did not have much effect

### Self-recruitment

MILTON 2014. Vertical migration increases self-recruitment, constraining larvae (also seen in BUTLER 2011).
MOKSNES 2014: Behaviour did not have much effect

### Settlement success

KLEIN 2016: Staying deeper increased settlement success
ABESAMIS 2016: Local retention drove settlement success
DRAKE 2015: DVM drove increased settlement success (although dependent on release depth)
HUBBARD & REIDENBARCH 2015: Vertical swimming increased settlement success.
ADAMS 2014: Vertical movement, in general, didn't increase settlement success.
MOKSNES 2014: Behaviour (vertical migration) increased settlement success
BIDEGAIN 2013: Vertical Behaviour increased settlement success
NEO 2013: Vertical behaviour did not influence settlement success


### Dispersal distance

KLEIN 2016: Surface and vertical migration the same (only considered top 10 m of the water column), at 10 m significantly reduced.
JONSSON 2016: Surface and longer PLD disperse the longest (reduce dispersal through height in the water column)
CRIALES 2015: Vertical migration changed dispersal, increasing dispersal (?)
ADAMS 2014: Vertical movement reduced dispersal distance
MOKSNES 2014: Behaviour (and depth) constrained dispersal distance

## Others

KOOL 2015, MOKSNES 2014, DRAKE 2011 - Spawning depth is important.
MOKSNES 2014, DRAKE 2011 - Spawning region is important.
DRAKE 2011 - Spawning time is important
DRAKE 2011 - Found changes in model time steps to only affect individual trajectories, not the overall connectivity.
