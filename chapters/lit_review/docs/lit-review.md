Making the right choices: understanding the impact of biophysical dispersal modelling on connectivity patterns

Abstract
--------

Biophysical dispersal models (BDMs) are a mature tool for assessing both potential and realised connectivity of marine species with a pelagic larval phase. BDMs are becoming more complex as more parameters, including biological behaviours, are included in connectivity models. With this added complexity, there does not appear to be a consensus about what the most important parameters are to include in a model. We synthesised 75 studies (with 367 models) to investigate the parameter choices made and collated common metrics from the resulting connectivity patterns. The first aim of this review is to examine the trends of parameter choice for BDMs, specifically how studies are including biological parameters. The second aim is to compare the inclusion of different parameters on reported common metrics of local retention, self-recruitment, settlement success, and dispersal distance. There was a lot of variation amongst the values for each parameter, but we found a greater proportion of studies were including biological behaviours, which is encouraging as larval behaviour is known to influence connectivity patterns. A combination of complexity in the numbers of parameters for each model and the lack of common metrics, made comparisons between models difficult. We found a mixture of surprising results such as model resolution not have a strong effect, and mortality not greatly reducing settlement success. Other results were more consistent with the literature, i.e. including larval behaviour increasing settlement success. To progress this field further we need to decide upon common metrics that allow meaningful comparisons between models, along with model validation against empirical results to start identifying the importance of different BDM parameters. The current start of field is seemingly not progressing, as there is no perceived consensus on the importance of various biological parameters from the trends seen in our review.

Biophysical dispersal models (BDMs) have been used to investigate marine dispersal patterns for three decades [@Bartsch:1988vg] becoming increasingly common in the last 10-15 years to estimate marine larval connectivity. BDMs produce potential patterns of connectivity using a physical (i.e. hydrodynamic) model, coupled with a biological model, encapsulating the biology of a marine species, to move the particles within the physical system [@Cowen:2009fm]. These models lend themselves to studies inferring distributional patterns for marine species with two distinct life stages, pelagic larval and contrasting sedentary adult phase. BDMs allow us to investigate questions that are inherently difficult to ask *in situ* [@Cowen:2009fm], from allowing us to investigate potential connectivity patterns over wide spatial scales [@Andrello:2013cc; @Treml:2015bt] and long temporal scales [@Richar:2014cg; @Berglund:2012cr]; to investigating how different early-life history traits (e.g. spawning times, diel migration, and swimming abilities) affect connectivity patterns [@Butler:2011wu; @Staaterman:2012ek].

Complexity and realism in BDMs has increased progressively; likely driven in part by both reduced costs of high performance computing, and increasing open access to high resolution oceanographic flow models and dispersal models. Basic research is also fuelling this trend, as studies are increasingly demonstrating the nektonic ability of pelagic marine larvae [@Leis2010325]. @Miller:2007iu evinced this trend in the review of ichthyoplankton biophysical modelling (referred to by Miller as individual-level, coupled physical-biological models), where 43.3% of studies implemented behaviour, predominately age-dependent vertical migration behaviour. This increased focus on the importance of the biology in BDMs has led to important insights about the role of larval behaviour in dispersal. Spawning behaviour (along with the location of the natal site) influences dispersal patterns [@Puckett:2014cx], and vertical movement of larval fish increases retention near the natal site and affect connectivity patterns [@Paris:2004te; @Brochier:2008hd; @Robins:2013ih; @Paris:2007hm]. Horizontal swimming has not been specifically included in BDMs (commonly implemented as a random walk) to the same extent as vertical migration, although combined with the ability for larvae to orientate towards a source, it is expected to influence larval connectivity patterns [@Leis:2007jh]. Directed swimming towards settlement sites increases settlement success, including settlement at or near the natal site [@Staaterman:2012ek; @Wolanski:2014eb]. From empirical studies, we know larval fish can achieve considerable swimming speeds, potentially giving the ability to out-swim the surrounding current, and it improves with growth [@Leis:2006kf].

This previous work has made it clear that the biological components of BDMs can strongly affect connectivity patterns; and this emphasis has been recognised in the ICES publication, "Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life", which recommends their inclusion and provides implementation guidance for researchers [@North:2009tx]. Larval behaviour is prominent in published BDM tools, such as the Connectivity Modelling System [CMS; @Paris:2013fs] & Connie3 (<http://www.csiro.au/connie/>). But despite this increasing attention paid to the importance of the biological model, there remains little consensus on the relative importance of different biological parameters. For BDMs to be a robust tool in understanding the connectivity of marine populations, such a consensus is ultimately required. Considerable context dependence of the relative importance of some biological parameters may exist (i.e. the importance of horizontal swimming may depend on the strength of the flow regime or the length of the larval period), while the inclusion of others may always make a large difference to the resulting connectivity patterns.

In this study, we review the recent literature on BDMs to evaluate the ability of this collective body of work to provide insight into the ramifications of the choices we make when attempting to include complexity and realism in our models. We achieve this aim by firstly evaluating if the field is progressing in its inclusion of biological parameters. We look at the collection of parameters included in BDMs, how this is changing over time, and if there are trends in how parameters are included (or excluded) based on the context of models. We define a model as a distinct collection of parameters for a BDM, and a study as a published collection of one or more models. Secondly, and most importantly, we look at the ramifications of the inclusion of different parameters on model results. Here we assess if there are observable differences in key metrics of connectivity as a result of the inclusion of specific biological parameters. We also assess the degree to which the physical context of the models regulate any observed effect of biological parameters. This information will serve to guide the application of BDMs into the future and by highlighting the ramifications of the inclusion/exclusion of key biological parameters. It will also identify gaps in our implementation of these parameters which should serve to identify necessary empirical work needed to address these shortcomings.

Methods

### Literature search

We searched for relevant studies using the keywords; connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. We found 75 studies (with 367 models) matching these criteria, published in 35 journals (see the full list of references and the data extracted in the supplementary materials). We constrained the search to publications from 2009, as this was the publication date of the ICES manual recommending the way forward for biophysical connectivity models [@North:2009tx], and also close to the date of the last review in this area [@Miller:2007iu]. Whilst our primary research interest was the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton, we included connectivity studies modelling other marine species with a pelagic larval stage and sedentary adult phase (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and corals), owing to often negligible differences in parameterised behaviours.

### Data classification

Most studies performed connectivity simulations using variations of their BDM, involving different input values for one or more parameters. This was often undertaken to test the effect of different parameters (representing different species/taxa or variations in behaviours of the same species/taxa) on resulting connectivity patterns. In this review, we separately identify each of these scenarios within a study and refer to each as a model.

We characterised each model within a study according to a variety of traits, which are broadly grouped into three themes. The first theme looked at context and the physical model, and how that was parameterised, e.g. information such as the location, particle tracking software, and hydrodynamic model used. To see if there was an effect of the modelled geographical area on settlement, the regions were broadly categorised into open (coastal, island) or closed (bay or inland sea). The second theme considered the larval trait parameters such as pelagic larval duration, settlement competency, spawning times, mortality, growth and behaviours, e.g. vertical migration. The length of the settlement competency window was determined as the time-period between larvae was first allowed to settle and the end of the pelagic larval duration. The third theme considered the metrics used to measure the connectivity patterns of the model and their specific values. In-excess of 20 different metrics were used to describe the patterns of connectivity predicted from BDMs. Several metrics were common amongst studies (i.e. dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices), while others were unique to a study. These metrics can be broadly categorised into two related classes. The first class included those metrics which summarised the dispersal kernel (mean, variance directionality) while the second captured metrics which identified connectivity pathways more explicitly (self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success; defined in @tbl:definitions). Specific values for every metric were not available from every study, and where possible, values were extracted from figures using the software package GraphClick (version 3.0.3; <http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/>).

### Data analysis

To address our aim of evaluating the application of biology in BDMs, we summarised model characteristics from our three themes and evaluated their relative occurrence and how this have changed over time. To address our aim of identifying the importance of including biological parameters on different metrics of connectivity as well as the context dependence of any such relationships, we compared each of the most commonly reported connectivity metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance) amongst models including certain parameters. Due to differences in the metrics reported or obtained from studies, there is considerable variation in the samples sizes for each metric. We required there be at least five studies for a given metric within a parameter group to conduct a comparison. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships of metrics and continuous model parameters and Student or Welch's t-tests (checking for equal variance using Bartlett's test) were used for comparisons between the metrics and categorical model parameters. To compare the influence of behaviours with the reported metrics, we used beta regressions and used least squares means to conducted post-hoc pairwise analysis using Tukey's procedure. We conducted all data analysis using the R programming language version 3.4.2 [@RAlanguageanden:wf] and the packages *betareg*, *car*, and *lsmeans*.


Current trends in biophysical connectivity modelling
----------------------------------------------------

There was an initial increase in the number of studies per year over the review period, which peaked in 2012 (20 studies) and steadily declined from then on (@fig:years). There was a mean of 10.7 BDM studies per year — the last eight years of Miller's (2007) review averaged of 6.6 studies, demonstrating the increased prevalence of BDM studies as a research tool. In this section, we explore the current trends in both input parameters and output metrics of connectivity studies, using the four model characteristic themes of model context, biological model parameters, and the metrics of connectivity used.

### The model context

Most of the connectivity studies used an existing BDM (85.3%), the rest either built a BDM to answer the study question (13.3%) or specific information about the BDM was missing from the methods (1.3%). This high model reuse suggests an increasing confidence in the model output and ease of adoption for end-users — both essential for maturing the field. Twenty-one different BDMs were used amongst the studies, although we were unable to identify the exact particle tracking model used for 22.7% of the studies. The three most popular BDMs used amongst the reviewed studies were Ichthyop [18.7%; @Lett:2008fo], CMS [12.0%; @Paris:2013fs], and MGET [8.0%; @Roberts:2010df]. The studies all used forecasting for their models, except for one hindcast solution, where the larvae are initially tracked from settlement sites to determine their natal sites [@Wren:2016gu]. The most popular hydrodynamic models used were ROMS (25.3%), the HYCOM (18.7%), and MARS3D (10.7%). @Miller:2007iu showed in their review the majority of studies used FEM (20%) or HANSOM (12.9%) and ROMS in 7.1% of studies. It shows a trend towards open-source models in recent years. The mean resolution of the hydrodynamic models was 4.7 km^2^, ranging from finest [50 m^2^; @Brennan:2014fm] to coarsest [33 km^2^; @Crochelet:2013kr]. In @Miller:2007iu the mean resolution was twice as coarse (10.8 km^2^). Some BPMs used nested hydrodynamic models (16.0%), to bypass issues of low resolution near coastal areas in modelling by using specific regional models. The hydrodynamic models covered 20 different oceanographic regions across the world, of which two studies investigated connectivity patterns at a global scale. As observed in @Miller:2007iu, modelling effort concentrated on highly industrialised fishing regions (i.e. the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea), and two-thirds were in temperate regions. Although, the number of studies in tropical regions increased to 32.9%, up from the 4.0% in @Miller:2007iu. The early-life histories of tropical marine species are commonly researched, and thus increased focus on tropical connectivity patterns is not unexpected.

The studies used different time-scales of oceanographic data depending on the connectivity questions asked (inter- or intra-annual). Although studies trended towards running the BDM over several years (median = 3 years), one-third used a single year (31.1%). One study used yearly average input data to interpret mean connectivity patterns [@Feutry:2013je], accounting for variation, while also reducing the runtime of the model. Other outliers included studies investigating climate change scenarios, which used periods of 60 years [@Aiken:2011fx] and 130 years [@Andrello:2014ge]. Not all studies used a continuous period for the hydrodynamic forcing, choosing instead to use a suite of specific years. As high-powered computing becomes more readily available and with the known variability between consecutive years in hydrodynamic modelling, the trend for BDMs should be towards using longer periods of ocean data as input, though there is little evidence for this trend over the past 20 years based on @Miller:2007iu and this review. It is important that models strive to include longer time frames, as this allows for inter-annual comparisons of connectivity patterns and accounts for natural variation in currents.

### How connectivity studies are parametrising the biological model

Ten marine taxonomic groups, and one generic group, were identified from models parametrised using 47 specific species and seven family level characteristics (@fig:taxa). The generic taxonomic group, applied in situations where a model used biological parameters that are applicable to multiple species, e.g. a specified pelagic larval duration. The most common taxonomic group was fish (41.3%; @fig:taxa), with the number of ichthyoplankton BDMs that were published each year consistent to that reported by @Miller:2007iu study. Generic species were the second most common, used in 38.0% of the models, although one study used 99 models (27.0% of the total models analysed in the review) implementing a suite of generic parameters [@Treml:2015bt].

The biological parameters implemented were not consistent across studies, apart from: pelagic larval duration (PLD; 99.2%) and spawning behaviour (92.9% - as mentioned previously there was a single hindcast study where spawning timing is not applicable; @tbl:behaviours). These traits are fundamental to connectivity studies for marine larvae and these results were expected. The lack of consistent implementation of other traits and behaviours could be attributed to a lack of concern that biology strongly influences patterns of connectivity. Given the recent publications acknowledging the influence of behaviour on connectivity patterns however, it’s probably reasonable to attribute this pattern to gaps in biological knowledge about the early-life history of many marine species which makes biological parametrisation uncertain.

The pelagic larval durations (PLD) values ranged from 2-420 days, with a median of 30 days. The PLDs were taken from published values for species or taxonomic family where available, with the longest PLDs occurring for invertebrate species (e.g. the long duration ~400 days for the phyllosoma larval stage of lobsters; [@Butler:2011wu; @Kough:2013fa). PLDs, about half the time, were used in conjunction with a settlement competency window (46.8%; @tbl:behaviours). The settlement competency window gives the marine larvae a period in which they are too young to settle, hence they become competent after a defined period. It is based on their known biology, where possible, incorporating the hypothesis that larvae must sufficiently develop morphological features before the pelagic larval stage can finish. The median start date when the larvae were considered developed enough to settle was nine days.

The spawning strategy was dependent on the biology of the modelled taxa and included pelagic eggs, demersal eggs, or brooding; implemented by changing the depth for the release of the larvae, e.g. demersal eggs were released on the bottom of the natal reef and pelagic eggs were released higher up the water column. The timing of when larvae were released varied from hourly intervals [@Jacobi:2012cz], daily [@Kough:2013fa], monthly [@Staaterman:2012ek], on lunar cycles [@Davies:2014cw] or a one-off spawning event [@Herbert:2011bh]. Typically, the spawning events were pre-determined, but several studies using variable release times initiated by ocean temperature [@Andrello:2014ge; @Rochette:2012io] or wave height — used by one study to spawn abalone larvae [@Miyake:2011hr]. The number of release and settlement sites were different for half of the studies (50.5%), often using a limited set of release sites with more available settlement sites to investigate the connectivity from known spawning areas. The number of larvae spawned varied considerably at each release site (10-10,000,000 larvae). The total larvae tracked in the system (spawning site multiplied by the number of sites, multiplied by the number of releases) had a similarly extended range of 328 in total to a sizeable 610 million, with a median of 2.4 million.

Larval mortality was implemented in only 40.2% of the models (@tbl:behaviours), which was higher than the 30.8% in Miller's (2007) review. However, the implementation of mortality varied across the models, and the most common mortality function used was a linear function (82.1%), thus a fixed percentage of the larvae were killed each day. The mean linear mortality rate used was 19.0%, ranging from 1.7% to 30.0%. Other mortality implementations were to kill the larvae based on a known temperature or salinity threshold (7.9%), using a decay function that decreased mortality based on age (7.9%) or using a Weibull function (2.1%). Unlike in Miller's 2007 review, where growth was implemented in one-third of the studies, only a small number of the models reviewed had the ability for larvae to grow (@tbl:behaviours).

The degree to which larvae can behave, specifically sense, orient and swim directionally (vertically or horizontally) is a fundamental concern in broader field of larval biology which has potentially important ramifications for connectivity. As discussed previously, this has been recognised in the world of BDMs, with general support for the inclusion of such behaviours. In this review, we classified models according to which of the four-major larval behaviours were implemented; no movement (passive movement), movement (e.g. horizontal or vertical swimming), orientation (ability to orientate towards a reef using sensory cues) and settlement (settle at a site using a sensory buffer or sticky zones). Larvae were given the ability to move in 29.1% of the models (@tbl:behaviours), conversely in 70.7% of the models the larvae were assumed to be passive and moved solely using the physical model. Miller (2007) observed that 43% of the fish studies in the reviewed papers implemented some movement behaviour, thus the percentage of BDM studies implementing larval behaviour is decreasing. Of the behaviours classified as movement, diel vertical migration was the most commonly implemented behaviour (41.1%). Ontogenetic vertical migration, the idea that marine species change their vertical position in the water column as a factor of their ontogeny, was used in 26.2% of the models. Horizontal swimming was implemented in 26.2% of the models, although it must be mentioned that random walks to mimic turbulence does encapsulate undirected horizontal swimming. A smaller number implemented vertical swimming in the larvae (4.7%). Some other movements included in models were prompted by environmental conditions such as tides (circatidal migration; 5.6%), salinity (halocline migration; 0.9%), or migrating with the pycnocline (5.6%). The ability of the marine larvae to sense settlement habitat was implemented in 50.8% of the models (@tbl:behaviours). The common approach was to implement a buffer or sticky zone around the settlement site (87.1%). The mean size of this sensory zone was 8.3 (± 5.2) km. The other implementation gave the larvae a detection distance relative to the the settlement site [@Staaterman:2012ek, @Wolanski:2014eb]. This settlement cue was used to allow the larvae to orientate towards, and thus swim in the direction of the reef if the larvae was within the cue distance ranging between 1-10 km (mean distance was 3.5 km), with a combination of early and late onset orientating abilities.

We compared the modelling of behaviours between two taxa groups, fish and invertebrates, for the reason that fish tend to have move swimming behaviour implemented based on their biology (ignoring generic taxa and non-animal models). Surprisingly movement was more consistently implemented in invertebrate models than fish, where 2010 and 2011 only had passive models with settlement (@fig:comparisons a, b). The proportion of fish models with passive larvae trended downwards over the course of the review, with movement included in more than half of all models in 2016 (@fig:comparisons c). For invertebrates, the proportions of actively moving to passive larvae occured in fairly equal proportions, except for 2014, when the majority were passive moving studies (@fig:comparisons d). Orientated swimming was only implemented in the fish models, and in low numbers (@fig:comparisons a). For both fish and invertebrates, the proportion of models implementing the ability to sense settlement habitat remained constant, although this proportion was higher in fish models (@fig:comparisons c, a).

There is growing empirical knowledge of larval fish behaviour influencing the outcome of connectivity [@Leis:2006kf; @Cowen:2009fm], and also BDM studies demonstrating that connectivity changes with the implementation of behaviour, suggesting the way forward is to include behaviour in connectivity models [@Staaterman:2014ee; @North:2009tx]. Therefore, this finding is interesting from a biological viewpoint, as the results show the majority of studies are not including any behaviour at all in their models; 73.9% of models implemented passive larvae, although it must be noted this trend was decreasing for ichthyoplankton BDMs (less than a quarter used passive larvae in 2016, @fig:comparisons c). There is also a well-established body of empirical literature which highlights the often-extensive swimming abilities of ichthyoplankton [@Leis:2006kf; @Leis2010325]. Even where horizontal swimming is not considered biologically important, it is well understood zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration patterns, migrating below the mixed layer, hypothesised due to predator avoidance [@Lampert:1989ww]. The important of vertical position is that the larvae are exposed to different current velocities (differing in magnitude and direction) at different depths in the water column. Several studies in the review showed that vertical migration (either diel or ontogenetic) increased self-recruitment and limit the dispersal kernel [@Young:2012gb; @Aiken:2011fx]. Orientation was only implemented in a small number of models, yet there is an increasing body of research in the last decade regarding the ability of reef fish larvae to orientate towards natal reefs using olfactory mechanisms [@Gerlach:2007gw], celestial cues [@Leis:2014es; @Faillettaz:2015dn] and a magnetic compass [@Bottesch:2016hl].

One possible reason for not implementing behaviour is that the complete (or even partial) early life history is often unknown for many species and researchers are trying to avoid using any behavioural assumptions in their models. Fish larval behaviour is known to be species specific, yet many models are limited to using known data from the family taxonomic level due to the lack of specific knowledge for the species of interest. It has been argued that this approach is fraught with danger, as behaviour can vary widely amongst species within a family taxonomic grouping [@Leis2010325]. This lack of species specific knowledge poses the question, can we only model species where we fully understand the early life history, or is there a degree of assumption that is deemed to still be scientifically valid to answer the study question. It also emphasises the empirical work that is still required to better understand fish early-life history.

### The metrics used to describe connectivity

There were more than 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of dispersal and settlement amongst the models. The three main approaches were to use combinations of dispersal kernels (70.7%), connectivity matrices (realised or potential; 52.2%) and graph theory (32.1%). Less common measures of model output were analyses using larval centre of mass (average geographical position of the larvae) [@Lacroix:2013cf; @Miyake:2011hr], isotropy (describes the inertia around the centre of mass) [@Ayata201018], positive area (number of areas that had larvae in them) [@Puckett:2014cx], and proportion of sites settled [@Robins:2013ih].

The trend in biophysical modelling is to present data using visual techniques such as heat maps, which, while being effective tools for visually communicating complex patterns qualitatively, are not amenable to the extraction of exact metric values. When a dispersal kernel was used, 71.9% of the time, the mean dispersal distance was reported. The most common connectivity values reported in the the reviewed studies–when a connectivity matrix was presented—were local retention (55.7%), self-recruitment (55.2%), and global settlement success of larvae (36.5%). However, while these response metrics were explicitly described, we were only able to extract actual values from 80.7%, 67.7%, and 55.2% of the studies in which connectivity matrices were described for self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success respectively. Based on the extracted data, there was a large spread of the mean self-recruitment amongst the models, ranging from 0-98%, depending on the study, with a median self-recruitment percentage of 13.0%. Local retention, had mean values ranging between 0.3% to 46.0% and a median of 8.1%. Mean settlement success of the larvae (available for 18.0% of the studies), ranged from 0.1% to 80.0% successful settlement rates, with a median of 17.0%. Mean dispersal distance (available from 15.2% of the studies) had a median value of 75.6 km per larvae (range of 9-668 km).

The high percentage of successfully settled larvae per model seems atypical for connectivity models. It was expected that the overall settlement success would be lower, even without mortality, due to the tendency of oceanographic currents to move larvae off-shore. There are caveats to this, size of settlement patch, size of grid hydrodynamic grid used (ability to capture inshore processes). Also keeping in mind that settlement success in these models do not reflect post-settlement processes. One other explanation could be in the implementation of these models, and how larvae are handled when they try and move on land - do they sit where they are and wait until a current velocity is favourable or do they die? The first option could artificially increase settlement near reefs for hydrodynamic models that do not capture inshore processes correctly. Perhaps because many studies have reported potential connectivity instead of realised connectivity (realised is a more accurate measure offset by biological processes such as egg production and/or mortality). The large ranges for the metrics of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success, was also unexpected. However, the large range of input parameters must be responsible for such variations - in the next section we explore how these modelling decisions affect these common metrics.

Influence of modelling decisions on connectivity metrics
--------------------------------------------------------

As indicated above, much of the variation observed in connectivity values and patterns across the reviewed studies will be driven by modelling environments, specifically parameter decisions. Here we attempt to use the body of reviewed literature to assess the impact of various model and parameter choices on resulting connectivity values. We have restricted consideration to only those model characteristics/input parameters and output connectivity metrics that were shared amongst the majority of studies, as described in the methods section. Specifically, we look at the impact of four characteristics of modelling environment (choice of model, model resolution, model design and study system) and four biological parameterisation decisions (larval duration, competency window, larval mortality and movement behaviour) on the key common metrics of connectivity (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success & dispersal distance). Note there are situations where there were not enough data points to make valid comparison of specific connectivity metrics and there are uneven sample sizes between the groups. Below we discuss the various components of models, outlining expected influences of each side on the identified response metrics and comparing this to what has been observed in the models summarised here:

### Modelling environment

The oceanographic systems were described as either open or closed, based on their geography (see methods). Logically, closed systems are predicted to increase both local retention and settlement success, as closed systems should lead to decreased rates of larval loss and increased chances of settlement. Self-recruitment is expected to either be lower or constant in a closed system, as while more local larvae will settle, there will be more recruits from other patches. Dispersal distance is expected to increase within an open system, as currents can take larvae further off-shore. We found self-recruitment and settlement success (38% and 22% higher respectively) trended higher in a closed system, although the differences were not significant (self-recruitment: t = 1.24, df = 16.5, p > 0.05; settlement success: t = 0.97, df = 64, p > 0.05). In an opposite trend, the mean local retention in open systems (6.6%) was significantly lower that in closed system (15.8%; t = -2.28, df = 37, p \< 0.05). Dispersal distance was 3.4 times greater in open systems, compared to closed (t = -3.75, df = 41.8, p \< 0.05). Only dispersal distance behaved as hypothesised, with the result of local retention being especially unexpected. Of course, this could be indicative of researchers appropriately choosing the boundaries of the modelled systems based on the biology of the modelled taxa. In this case, even seemingly open systems, may in fact be demographically closed ones. This can be explained by the geographical nature of an open system, potentially allowing more larvae to be dispersed away from settlement sites and into large oceanic features. There were not enough data points on local retention for a meaningful comparison.

There is no clear effect of either particle-tracking model or hydrodynamic model choice on the resulting connectivity metrics (see Supplementary Materials S1). In general, model choices produced more consistent local retention and dispersal distance values, and highly variable settlement success and self-recruitment values. Although this trend was not consistent, for example within the choice of particle tracking model, the Connectivity Modelling System (CMS) had relatively consistent reported values of self-recruitment, but rather variable settlement success and dispersal distance. Studies using HYCOM and POM had the largest ranges amongst the metrics for hydrodynamic models, while ROMS and HANSOM had the least variation. Without knowing the specifics of various BDMs, we expected there to be inherent variation due to the different implementations. local-retention. The large variation in resulting metrics for both particle tracking and hydrodynamic models suggest there are other factors than implementation influencing the metrics, which is a welcome result.

Nested hydrodynamic models (i.e. sub-models with higher resolution to capture coastal dynamics), used in more complex BDMs to capture small scale regional processes, are expected to give better connectivity patterns due to the increased realism. Following from this, hydrodynamic models with finer resolution should also produce more realistic connectivity patterns. It must be noted that this is not an option for many BDMs, where the hydrodynamic model is determined by availability. Increasing resolution, through both overall finer spatial resolution or using nested models, to capture small scale coastal dynamics like eddies, should in theory, increase reported values of local retention and settlement success, while lowering the dispersal distance. Self-recruitment is more complex due to the connectedness of the system, with the simplest prediction being that there will be not change due to steady increase of local and external settlement. We found a significant positive predictive relationship between the resolution of the hydrodynamic model and local retention (r^2^ = 0.82, F(1,17) = 79.11, p \< 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel a), but no relationship between model resolution and the other metrics, self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.05, F(1,57) = 2.75, p > 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel b), settlement success (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,64) = 0.77, p > 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel c), or dispersal distance (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,51) = 0.69, p > 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel d). When using nested hydrodynamic models, the self-recruitment significantly reduced (28.8% versus 0.9%; t = 7.15, df = 49.1, p\<0.05). However, caution should be used when evaluating this result due to the large unbalance samples between the groups (only 10 models reporting self-recruitment had nested designs, whereas 50 did not). Similar to model resolution, there was no significant difference in the settlement success or dispersal distance when using nested models, and there were no studies using nested models where we were able to get local retention values. Counter-intuitively to our prediction, local retention was found to increase as the resolution gets coarser, although it is a relationship driven by one data point at 10 km (@fig:metrics_panel a). Self-recruitment fit our prediction for increased the model resolution, but was found to reduce with nested models, demonstrating the complexity of the metric. The results of settlement success and dispersal distance not changing with finer resolution models, also ran counter to our predictions. This suggests that the you can get accurate overall settlement and dispersal distance with coarser models, but the local retention and self-recruitment values might not be as realistic.

### Biological parameterisation

As indicated above, the length of the larval period (PLD) was one of only a few biological parameters implemented in every model. Given its fundamental importance in the modelling process (the general basis for the duration of any given model run) it would be expected to have impacts on foremost the dispersal distance as larvae can spend more time in the water. The longer larvae are allowed to remain pelagic before settling, increases the potential for long-distance dispersal. Therefore it is expected that local retention will decrease, as more particles and disperse further away. Self-recruitment will most likely stay the same, as while local settlement will potentially reduce, less larvae from neighbouring reefs will also settle. However, again it relies on the connectedness of the region, as larvae from further away reefs could start settling and driving down self-recruitment. It is predicted that settlement success will not change, as increasing the PLD might reduce local settlement, but open up new potential areas of settlement away from the natal reef. We found local retention to the natal site showed a significant positive relationship with the length of PLD (r^2^ = 0.27, F(1,36) = 14.79, p \< 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel e). There was no relationship with either self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.00, F(1,54) = 1.12, p > 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel f) or settlement success (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,79) = 1.91, p > 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel g). Dispersal distance had a weak relationship with PLD (r^2^ = 0.22, F(1,45) = 13.63, p \< 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel h), only partly supporting our hypothesis, as only 22% of the variation was explained by the relationship and the slope was gradual. This is consistent with the literature where different relationships have been found [@Mora:2012kn; @Corell:2012id], suggesting other factors. Any relationship between dispersal distance and PLD would effect the settlement success, dependent on the geographic location of available settlement sites. We found both settlement success and self-recruitment behaved as we predicted, showing no relationship with PLD. Contrary to out predictions, local retention was found to increase with PLD, perhaps increasing the pelagic time gave larvae more time to find the natal site again, although caution must again be applied as the relationship appears to be driven by three PLDs over 40 days (the rest were below 30; @fig:metrics_panel e).

The settlement competency window (the size of which is constrained by the pelagic larval duration), was implemented in about half of the models and is thought to directly effect the settlement success. The longer a larvae is allowed to settlement, theoretically the increased chance of finding some available settlement habitat, therefore it is predicted settlement success would increase. Increasing the size of the window also allows larvae to settle earlier if the habitat is conducive, thus we predicted that local retention and self-recruitment would both increase. Along these lines it is expected that dispersal distance would decrease. The settlement competency window, dependent on the pelagic larval duration, was found to be weakly positively correlated with self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.23, F(1,18) = 6.69, p \< 0.05). The was no significant relationship with local retention (r^2^ = 0.06, F(1,29) = 2.98, p > 0.05), settlement success (r^2^ = -0.02, F(1,44) = 0.07, p > 0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^ = -0.02, F(1,15) = 0.76, p > 0.05). An increase in self-recruitment with the size of the settlement window was as predicted, although this same relationship was not seen in local retention. The size of the settlement competency window should be tightly linked to probability of settlement success and dispersal distance for an individual larvae. However here we saw neither of these, perhaps any observable relationships are masked by the impact of parameterisation decisions made by these models which may have stronger effects on settlement success (e.g. mortality, see below).

Mortality, a great unknown factor in pelagic larval life stages (except that it is high) was implemented in more than one-third of models. Implementing mortality changes derived connectivity patterns from mere potential to realistic patterns of connectivity, whereby high mortality in early stages of ontogeny limits the tails of the dispersal kernel and flattens the peak. Therefore logically it follows that including mortality will greatly reduce the settlement success and local-retention of larvae, along with reducing the dispersal distance. While dependent on the scheme of mortality, if its a constant linear rate, self-recruitment should not change much as the proportions should remain constant — if anything it might slightly increase as long distance transport is reduced. There was a significant positive effect on local retention when mortality was applied (t = -3.21, df = 4.3, p \< 0.05; @fig:mortality a). It was found that models which included mortality had similar levels of self-recruitment (t = -1.54, df = 58, p > 0.05; @fig:mortality b) and settlement success (t = 0.35, df = 84, p > 0.05; @fig:mortality c) to models run without mortality. Including mortality also had no effect on the dispersal distance of the marine larvae (t = -1.16, df = 9.1, p > 0.05; @fig:mortality d). Neither settlement success or dispersal distance lessened with mortality as predicted, but mortality did reduce the variation of the settlement success and the dispersal distance (apart from two outliers). The fact the settlement success values did not change is a strange result. Self-recruitment behaved as expected, and the variation increased, which would occur if settlement success also decreased, as less larvae would be arriving from other sites. Local retention behaved the opposite to our expectations, increase more than double when mortality was included, however the degrees of freedom for interpreting this result are low due to the unbalanced sample sizes. The high values for both local retention and settlement success when mortality are curious, as intuitively the high mortality rates of larvae (average values used were 10% per day), should greatly lower both these metrics, and as such we cannot deduce a reasonable explanation.

Behaviour of marine larvae, was classified into four areas for this review, as specified earlier. We compared the metrics against passive larvae, larvae that can swim (undirected horizontal and vertical), sense settlement habitats (using a buffer or sticky zones), and orientation (directed swimming towards settlement habitats). While we also looked at a combination of these behaviours, only the combination of movement and sensing settlement behaviours had enough models and reported values for comparisons. Local retention was expected to increase when movement behaviour was implemented, based on previous results [@Paris:2004te]. However, settlement sensory behaviour or orientation are predicted to not have a discernible effect on local retention. It is unclear how self-recruitment should be affected by behaviour, as local retention increases, self-recruitment would also increase, unless movement also increases long-distance dispersal by exposing larvae to currents with different velocities, which would in turn reduce self-recruitment as more external recruits settle to a patch. Settlement success should increase with behaviour, as movement increases the ability to find settlement patches, settlement sensory behaviour and orientation allows larvae to find patches easier when they are competent to settle. Dispersal distance is hypothesised to decrease with behaviour, as passive larvae are exposed to the strongest surface currents and settlement sensory behaviour and orientation both allow for larvae to settle earlier by navigating to suitable habitats. The effect of behaviour on local retention was negligible from the limited data in our review, there was no data to contrast settlement or movement and settlement behaviours (@fig:behaviours a). Even though the mean local retention for passive particles was slightly decreased for orientation and slightly increased with movement, there were no differences found between the groups. The only behaviour that produced significantly different self-recruitment values from passive larvae was orientation (estimate = -0.20, SE = 0.06, z-ratio = 3.35, p \< 0.05; @fig:behaviours b). Orientation also produced significantly lower self-recruitment (18% less) compared to only settlement sensory behaviour (estimate = -0.18, SE = 0.06, z-ratio = -2.952, p \< 0.05), and compared to movement and settlement sensory behaviour combined (40% less; estimate = -0.43, SE = 0.09, z-ratio = -4.60, p \< 0.05). Self-recruitment was significantly increased (30%) when settlement sensory behaviour was combined with movement, compared to movement (estimate = 0.31, SE = 0.10, z-ratio = 3.002  p \< 0.05). The highest values of settlement success (mean of 50.2%), was achieved when combining movement and settlement sensory behaviour (@fig:behaviours c). It was significantly higher, approximately 30% higher than passive (estimate = 0.34, SE = 0.09, z-ratio = 3.70, p \< 0.05), movement (estimate = 0.28, SE = 0.10, z-ratio = 2.95, p \< 0.05), and settlement sensory behaviour (estimate = 0.30, SE = 0.11, z-ratio = 2.73, p \< 0.05). The only behaviour it was not different to was orientation. The rest of the behaviours did not produce significantly different values of settlement success. Dispersal distance significantly increased by over 300 km when settlement sensory behaviour with (estimate = 0.29, SE = 0.13, z-ratio = -2.68, p \< 0.05) or without movement (estimate = 0.28, SE = 0.14, z-ratio = -2.63, p \< 0.05) was included in the model compared to passive larvae (@fig:behaviours d). The variation when including only settlement behaviours was extreme compared to the other behaviours. There were no reported values for models that included orientation. While our hypothesis, based on previous results, have shown behaviour to increase local retention, we found there to be no differences. The low number of data points for local retention could have led to this unexpected result — we have no data points for either settlement sensory or the combination of movement and settlement sensory. The surprising result for self-recruitment was that combining settlement sensory behaviours and movement increased the proportion so greatly as compared to implementing only movement. The logic behind this is puzzling, as settlement sensory should increase settlement success overall, but evenly across all the habitats. Including movement, settlement sensory or a combination of the two over passive behaviour, while reducing variation, did not produce significantly different self-recruitment values as predicted. For movement and settlement sensory, values tended to be lower suggesting more long distance transport, yet each had outliers of reported high self-recruitment rates @fig:behaviours b). As hypothesised, there was a clear trend that including behaviour increased the settlement success of larvae in a model. The only behaviour to not fit into the trend was orientation, which still trended to higher values, but the variation in the low number of reported results meant no significant differences could be found. Dispersal distance behaved the opposite as predicted, increased significantly when settlement sensory behaviour and settlement sensory and movement behaviour was included. The variation of dispersal distance for models including settlement sensory models was extreme compared to other behaviours. Behaviour has been demonstrated to both limit [@Butler:2011wu] and increase [@Corell:2012id] the dispersal distance of pelagic larvae, suggesting how the behaviour is parameterised, as well as interactions between parameters is important.


Conclusion and recommendations
------------------------------

The current state of the field gives the impression it is not moving forward as coherently it should be in the eight years since the ICES manual of recommended practices was published [@North:2009tx]. A significant reason for this is likely the absence of published data on the early-life history of many marine species, highlighting a key area of required future research. Without data, it is difficult to justify introducing behaviour into models, as robust models aim to minimise assumptions. The popularity of BDMs as a connectivity research tool has been on a downward trend since 2012. However, the implementations of these models are getting more complex in recent years, especially for ichthyoplankton, now more BDMs implemented larval movement behaviours than without. Other behaviours of settlement sensory strategies and orientation were consistently (or sporadically in the case of orientation) implemented across the review period for models of either fish or invertebrate species, not reflecting the trend of movement. Researchers appear to be heeding the recommendations of publications such as the ICES manual [@North:2009tx] and other research showing the importance of movement in influencing connectivity patterns. From a biological viewpoint this is encouraging, as it is in keeping with the research showing that biology matters in dispersal.

The most surprising result from the modelling environment parameters was that the model resolution (either global resolution or through nested models), had no strong effect on the metrics we investigated. This result doesn't mean we shouldn't aim for better precision in hydrodynamic models, but it does give confidence when using a BDM to investigate connectivity with regions where only coarser models are available. There was a lot of variation between the particle tracking models and hydrodynamic models for all the metrics without any noticeable patterns, for which we have no explanation. Choice of hydrodynamic model would be based on regional availability, whereas the decision on which particle tracking models to use can be down to other tangible choices e.g. user experience, native operating system, or required computing power. The effect of open and closed systems was not as strong as expected either, suggesting perhaps open systems are not as "open" as we believe them to be and they still exhibit strong levels of settlement success and self-recruitment.

The length of pelagic larval duration was shown to not have a strong effect the metrics, only two weak relationships with dispersal distance and local-retention. Therefore the length of time spent in the ocean by ichthyoplankton appears not to increase the chances of settlement, but rather increases the distance between natal and settlement site. The length of the window to settle had unexpected results, having no effect on settlement success, local retention and dispersal distance. These results provide studies parameterising these PLD and settlement windows using limited known data for their species of interest, more confidence in generating connectivity patterns. Mortality, almost perturbingly, didn't reduce the settlement success anywhere near expected for unexplained reasons. To capture realised connectivity patterns, instead of potential patterns, some form of realistic mortality must be applied. In general, introducing behaviour (movement, settlement sensory, movement with settlement sensory, or orientation) increased the  settlement success and the dispersal distance of the larvae. It also change the values of self-recruitment, generally lowering self-recruitment, except in one case. Therefore implementing some behaviour it seen to be beneficial to passive particles, and at least needs to be considered when generating connectivity patterns. Obviously parametrising some of there behaviours can be difficult due to the lack of information, however even a simple sensory system such as *sticky water* can have a strong effect on the metrics we considered.

The large variation seen in both the model inputs and the connectivity metrics produced from these BDMs was unexpected. Variability of metrics is likely driven by the non-trivial number of parameter choices made, both physical and biological, in BDMs, many of which are optional or species specific. There is a grey area when determining what information to include in a model and what level of accuracy and precision is required for biological inputs. Connectivity metrics of self-recruitment, local-retention, and settlement success appear to be affected by different model inputs, which underscores the inherent complexity. It is also near impossible to compare models due to the wide range of parameter choices involved and hence differ between models. This complexity makes it difficult to learn and move forward using the model outputs, ultimately limiting our capacity for making more informed decisions with respect to our models.

This review has also highlighted the lack of unity in both input parameters and metrics to describe the output of the BDMs. There is no consensus on what biological parameters to choose when implementing a model, i.e. what behaviours are required in a BDM to accurately estimate the connectivity for a reef fish species. BDMs are non-trivial models, making it difficult to standardise the output in order to produce simple comparisons. Although agreement about common metrics and consistent metrics reporting would help alleviate these issues. Standardisation of metrics will also assist in validating the estimated patterns of connectivity with empirical studies (e.g. genetic studies, comparisons long-term known recruitment data and other techniques where appropriate), providing important model validation. This would provide a formal framework to validate BDMs against empirical studies that have measured some or all of these metrics, and allow us to fine tune the importance of required parameters. The inherent difficulty of course lies in empirical studies being able to measure these metric, and to begin with it will only be possible for small scale studies. Model validation should be an ultimate goal of BDM studies, especially as understanding connectivity is a central tenet of applied marine ecology, including designing marine reserves [@Almany:2009io; @Bode:2016bq].

In conclusion, we believe in order for this field to progress further, we need to better understand the relative importance of different behaviours of connectivity for ichthyoplankton and other marine families (potentially species/taxa specific). This understanding will us to generate baseline models for connectivity and highlight areas of knowledge gaps in early-life history that need to be addressed so we can confidently parametrise these BDMs and generate better outcomes.
