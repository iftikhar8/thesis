Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) has been used to investigate marine dispersal patterns for 30 years [@Bartsch:1988vg], becoming increasingly utilised in the last 15 years to estimate marine larval connectivity. BDMs produce potential patterns of connectivity using a physical (i.e. oceanographic) model, coupled with biological model of larval particles, encapsulating a marine species of interest using their understood biology [@Cowen:2009fm]. These BDMs lend themselves to studies inferring distributional patterns for marine species with two distinct life stages, a pelagic larval and contrasting sedentary adult phases. BDMs are powerful research tools, allowing us to investigate potential connectivity patterns over wide spatial scales [@Andrello:2013cc; @Treml:2015bt] and long temporal scales [@Richar:2014cg; @Berglund:2012cr], that are experimentally difficult to capture using current empirical methods [@Cowen:2009fm]. These models also provide us the ability to investigate how different early-life history traits (e.g. mortality, swimming ability, and orientation) affect the patterns of connectivity [@Butler:2011wu; @Staaterman:2012ek], questions that are inherently difficult to ask *in situ*.

Complexity and realism in BDMs has increased progressively; driven in part by both greater access to high performance computing, and open access high resolution oceanographic flow models and dispersal models. Research is also fuelling this trend, as studies are increasingly demonstrating the ability of pelagic larvae to affect their own fate via a variety of intrinsic behaviours [@Leis2010325]. This trend was clear in [-@Miller:2007iu] review of ichthyoplankton biophysical modelling (referred to by Miller as individual-level, coupled physical-biological models), where 43.3% of studies implemented behaviour, predominately age-dependent vertical migration behaviour. This increased focus on the importance of the biology in BDMs has led to important insights about the role of larval behaviour in dispersal. Spawning behaviour (along with the location of the natal site) has been shown to significantly affect dispersal patterns [@Puckett:2014cx]. Vertical movement of larval fish has been shown increase retention near the natal site and affect connectivity patterns [@Paris:2004te; @Brochier:2008hd; @Robins:2013ih; @Paris:2007hm]. Horizontal swimming has not been included in BDMs to the same extent as vertical migration, although combined with orientation, it can likely influence connectivity patterns [@Leis:2007jh]. Orientated swimming towards swimming towards settlement sites has been shown to increase settlement success, including settlement at or near the natal site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. From empirical studies we know larval fish can achieve considerable swimming speeds, potentially giving the ability to out-swim the surrounding current, and it improves with growth [@Leis:2006kf].

This previous work has made it clear that the biological components of transport models can strongly affect connectivity patterns; and this emphasis has been recognised in the ICES publication, "Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life", which recommends their inclusion and provides implementation guidance [@North:2009tx]. Larval behaviour has also been emphasised in published BDM tools, such as the Connectivity Modelling System [@Paris:2013fs] & Connie [@Connie:w_9C7zRQ]. But despite this increasing attention paid to the inclusion of biology in BDMs, there remains little consensus on the relative importance of different parameters. If BDMs are to be a robust tool for understanding the connectivity of marine populations, such a consensus is ultimately required. It may be that there is considerable context dependence to the relative importance of some biological parameters (i.e. the importance of horizontal swimming may depend on the strength of the flow regime or the length of the larval period), while the inclusion of others may always make a large difference to connectivity (i.e.. mortality).

In this study we review the literature on BDMs to evaluate the ability of this collective body of work to provide insight into the ramifications of the choices we make when attempting to include biological realism in transport models. We achieve this aim by firstly evaluating if the field is progressing in its inclusion of biological parameters. We look at the collection of parameters included in models, how this is changing over time, and if there are trends in how parameters are included (or excluded) based on the context of models. Secondly, we look at the ramifications of the inclusion of different parameters on model results. Here we evaluate if there are observable differences in key metrics of connectivity as a result of the inclusion of specific biological parameters. We also assess the degree to which the physical context of the models regulate any observed effect of biological parameters. This information will serve to guide the application of BDMs into the future and by highlighting key biological parameters, allows for focusing of empirical studies where they are most needed.

Methods
-------

### Literature search

We searched for relevant studies using the keywords; connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. We found 77 studies matching these criteria, published in 34 different journals (see the full list of references and the data extracted in the Supplementary materials). We constrained the search to publications from 2009, as this was the publication date of the ICES manual recommending the way forward for biophysical connectivity models [@North:2009tx], and also close to the date of the last review in this area [@Miller:2007iu]. Whilst our primary research interest is the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton, we included connectivity studies modelling other marine species with a pelagic larval stage and sedentary adult phase (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and corals), owing to often negligible differences in parameterised behaviours.

### Data classification

Most studies performed connectivity simulations using variations of their BDM, involving different input values for one or more parameters. This was often undertaken to test the effect of different parameters (representing different species/taxa or variations in behaviours of the same species/taxa) on resulting connectivity patterns. In this review, we separately identify each of these scenarios within a study and refer to each as a model.

We characterised each model within a study according to a variety of traits, which are broadly grouped into four themes. The first theme, model context, looked at general information about the study, such as study motivation, location, model species, and whether the system was tropical or temperate. To see if there was an effect of the modelled geographical area on settlement, the regions were broadly categorised into open (coastal, island) or closed (bay or inland sea). The second theme focused on the inputs used to parametrise the physical model. Assessing the physical model included details such as the oceanographic model used, the particle tracking software, diffusion methods and the model time-step. The third theme considered the input parameters of the biological model, recording larval traits such as pelagic larval duration, settlement competency, spawning times, mortality, growth and behaviours, e.g. vertical migration. The length of the settlement competency window determined as the time-period between the first age of settlement competency and the end of the pelagic larval duration. The fourth theme investigated the metrics used to measure the connectivity patterns of the model and their specific values. In-excess of 25 different metrics were used to describe the patterns of connectivity predicted from BDMs. Some metrics were common amongst studies (i.e. dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices), while others were uniquely derived (defined in @tbl:definitions). These metrics can be broadly categorised into two related classes. The first class included those metrics which summarised the dispersal kernel (mean, variance directionality) while the second captured metrics which identified connectivity pathways more explicitly (self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success). Specific values for every metric were not available from every study, and where values were included in figures we used the publicly available software package GraphClick (version 3.0.3; <http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/>).

### Data analysis

To address our aim of evaluating the application of biology in BDMs, we summarized model characteristics from our first three themes and evaluated their relative occurrence and how this have changed over time. We conducted all data analysis using the R programming language version 3.3.2 [@RAlanguageanden:wf], and using the helper packages contained in *tidyverse* to manipulate and visualise the data [@Wickham:2016te]

To address our aim of identifying the importance of including biological parameters on different metrics of connectivity as well as the context dependence of any such relationships, we compared each of the most commonly reported connectivity metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance) amongst models grouped by the different biological parameters included. Due to variation in the nature of the metrics reported or obtained between studies, there is considerable variation in the samples sizes for each metric. We required there be a minimum of five studies for a given metric within a parameter group in order to conduct a comparison. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships of metrics and continuous model parameters and Student's t-tests (checking for equal variance using Bartlett's test) were used for comparisons between the metrics and categorical model parameters.

Current trends in biophysical connectivity modelling
----------------------------------------------------

There was an initial increase in the number of studies per year over the review period, which peaked in 2012 (20 studies) and steadily declined from then on (@fig:years). The average number of BDM studies published per year in our review was 15.3. The last 8 years of Miller's (2007) review averaged of 6.6 studies, demonstrating BDM studies have become more prevalent as a research tool. In this section we explore the current trends in both input parameters and output metrics of connectivity studies, using the four model characteristic themes of model context, physical model parameters, biological model parameters, and the metrics of connectivity used.

![The number of studies per year included in the review](../figs/years.png){#fig:years}

### Model context

Ten specific and one generic marine taxonomic groups were identified in the studies we reviewed (@fig:taxa). The generic taxonomic group was used by studies that defined as a suite of biological parameters that could potentially apply to multiple species, e.g. many species of reef fish most likely have a pelagic larval duration of 20 days. Generic species were used in 40.2% of the models, although one study used 99 models (28.4% of the total analysed models in the review) implementing a suite of generic parameters [@Treml:2015bt]. The 10 known taxonomic groups were comprised from 47 species and another seven where the modelled biological group was specified at the family level, e.g. Labridae or Sparidae. The number of ichthyoplankton BDMs that were published each year was consistent with that reported by (2007).

![The different taxonomic groups that parameterised the biological models used in the BDM studies](../figs/taxa.png){#fig:taxa}

Most of the connectivity studies used an existing BDM (82.6%), the rest either build a BDM to answer the study question (16.0%) or information about the BDM was missing from the methods (1.4%). This high model reuse suggests an increasing maturity in the model output and the ease of adoption for end-users. The three most popular BDMs used amongst the reviewed studies were Ichthyop (18.7%) [@Lett:2008fo], Connectivity Modelling System (12.0%) [@Paris:2013fs], & MGET (8.0%) [@Roberts:2010df]. Twenty-one different BDMs were used amongst the studies, although we were unable to identify the exact particle tracking model used for 22.7% of the studies. The studies all used forecasting for their models, except for one hindcast solution (whereby the larvae are initially tracked from settlement sites to determine their natal sites) [@Wren:2016gu].

The overwhelming motivation for using a BDM was to answer questions about dispersal and settlement (68.0%). Dispersal models without settlement (13.3%) and studies motivated by investigating marine park connectivity (12.0%) occurred less frequently. Theoretical based studies (4.0%) and studies investigating how climate change effects connectivity (2.7%) were more sporadic motivations. A handful of studies used a purely theoretical approach to understanding the biology that influences connectivity, although within another applied context, e.g. using different species in a study that have varied behaviours or traits, studies indirectly accomplished this.

The studies in this review used hydrodynamic models covering 20 different oceanographic regions across the world, of which two studies investigated connectivity patterns at a global scale. As observed in Miller's (2007) [-@Miller:2007iu] review, modelling effort concentrated on highly industrialised fishing regions, such as the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea and most studies were of temperate regions (64.9%), though the number of studies in tropical oceanic regions increased from 4.0% to 32.4%. The early-life histories of tropical marine species are commonly researched, and thus increased focus on tropical connectivity patterns is not unexpected.

The studies used different time-scales of oceanographic data depending on the connectivity questions asked (inter- or intra-annual). Studies trended towards running the BDM over a handful of years (median = 3 years), with the majority using a single year in their connectivity study (26.9%). One study used yearly average input data to interpret mean connectivity patterns [@Feutry:2013je], accounting for variation, while also reducing the runtime of the model. Other outliers included studies investigating climate change scenarios, which used periods of 60 years [@Aiken:2011fx] and 130 years [@Andrello:2014ge]. In these studies, the earliest year modelled was 1950, and the latest year modelled was 2100 (forecasting ocean currents using past trends). The mean start date for the hydrodynamic data was 2001, and a mean end date of 2008. Not all studies used a continuous period for the hydrodynamic forcing, choosing instead to use a suite of specific years. As high-powered computing becomes more readily available and with the known variability between consecutive years in hydrodynamic modelling, the trend for BDMs should be towards using longer periods of ocean data as input, though there is little evidence for this trend over the past 20 years based on [-@Miller:2007iu] and this review. Moving in this direction is important in this direction, as modelling longer periods of time allow for inter-annual comparisons of connectivity patterns and account for natural variation in currents.

### How connectivity studies are parameterising the physical model

The two most common ocean circulation models used were the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS; 25.3%) and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; 17.3%). More complex BPMa used a number of circulation models (16.2%) to bypass issues of low resolution near coastal areas in modelling. [-@Miller:2007iu] showed in their review the majority of studies used Finite Element Models (FEM; 20%) or Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM; 12.9%) and ROMS in only 7.1% of studies. It shows a trend towards open-source models, which are readily available on the Internet and present day connections allow for expeditious download times of these large datasets. The hydrodynamic models had a mean resolution of 5.6 km^2^, ranging from the finest resolution of 50 m^2^ [@Brennan:2014fm] to the coarsest at 33 km^2^ [@Crochelet:2013kr]. The mean resolution is half that of Miller's 2007 review (10.8 km^2^), so while there was no trend over time to higher resolution models, between reviews hydrodynamic precision improved.

The tracking time-step for larvae in the system (environmental forcing) were either fixed time-steps or varied per other factors. Runge-Kutta fourth-order integration (RK4) was used in 48.1% of the studies, a technique that allows for approximating velocity at smaller time-steps than the time interval used in the physical model (usage of RK4 might be higher as 33.8% of the studies did not specify the integration scheme used). The median time-step was one hour, and ranged between 60 seconds [@Moritz:2013dc] and 24 hours [@Mora:2012kn]. Miller (2007) reported the same median time-step, with similar ranges. The time-step used was not reported in 37.3% of the studies. No clear rationale was given for the choice of time-step amongst the studies, likely determined by the choice of physical model and computational reasons.

### How connectivity studies are parametrising the biological model

The biological parameters implemented were not consistent across studies, apart from: pelagic larval duration (PLD; 99.4%) and spawning behaviour (92.5% - as mentioned previously there was a single hindcast study where spawning timing is not applicable; @tbl:behaviours). These traits are fundamental to connectivity studies for marine larvae and these results were expected. Lack of consistency in the other traits and behaviours captured by the biological models could be attributed to researchers not believe that biology strongly influences patterns of connectivity. Unlikely, given the recent publications acknowledging the influence of behaviour on connectivity patterns. A more reasonable explanation is that gaps in biological knowledge about the early-life history of many marine species make biological parametrisation uncertain.

#### Pelagic larval duration

The studies we reviewed exhibited two different approaches when implementing the pelagic larval duration. The standard approach (87.9% of models) was to make the PLD value fixed for each larva. If the individual larva reaches this time, it either must settle (if possible) or it is considered dead. The other approach was to implement variability in the PLD (6.3% of models), either using a Gaussian distribution (based on knowledge of the population) or instead of using time, make the PLD dependent on another variable, i.e. temperature. A combination of the two strategies was used in 4.9% of the models. The fixed PLD values ranged from a concise two days up to a duration of 420 days, with a median of 30 days. The PLDs were taken from published values for species or taxonomic family where available, with the longest PLDs occurring for invertebrate species e.g. the long duration (~400 days) for the phyllosoma larval stage of lobsters [@Butler:2011wu; @Kough:2013fa].

#### Spawning strategies

The spawning strategy was typically dependent on the biology of the modelled taxa and included pelagic eggs, demersal eggs, or brooding. To implement these different strategies, studies changed depth for the release of the larvae, e.g. demersal eggs were released on the bottom of the natal reef and pelagic eggs were released higher up the water column. The two strategies for releasing the particles at depth were either to use a fixed depth (37.5%), or to randomly release the larvae over a range of depth values (60.8%), i.e. release larvae in in the 0-20 m range of the water column. The timing of when larvae were released varied from hourly intervals [@Jacobi:2012cz], daily [@Kough:2013fa], monthly [@Staaterman:2012ek], on lunar cycles [@Davies:2014cw] or a one-off spawning event [@Herbert:2011bh]. Typically, the spawning events were pre-determined, using known spawning times, but several studies using variable release times initiated by ocean temperature [@Andrello:2014ge; @Rochette:2012io] or wave height — used by one study to spawn abalone larvae [@Miyake:2011hr]. While the number of release and settlement sites were the same for most studies, several studies (15.6%) used a limited set of key release sites with more available settlement sites to investigate the connectivity from known spawning areas. The number of larvae spawned at each release site ranged from 10 larvae up to 10 million, with a median of 6,800. The total larvae tracked in the system (spawning site multiplied by the number of sites, multiplied by the number of releases) had a similarly extended range of 328 in total to a sizeable 610 million, with a median of 3.2 million. To simplify tracking these large numbers of larvae in the system, five studies (6.5%) used the super-individual concept, whereby a single larva in the system represents a sizeable number of larvae with a normalised collection of attributes. There are large computational benefits to this approach, especially in models that use a continuous space. The caveat is that you must consider how much individual variation you are willing to lose by modelling these super-individuals.

#### Settlement competency window

PLDs, about half the time, were used in conjunction with a settlement competency window (46.8%; @tbl:behaviours). The settlement competency window gives the marine larvae a period in which they are too young to settle, hence they become competent after a defined period. It is based on their known biology, where possible, incorporating the hypothesis that larvae must sufficiently develop morphological features before the pelagic larval stage can finish. The median start date when the larvae were considered developed enough to settle was nine days.

#### Mortality and growth

Larval mortality was implemented in only 40.2% of the models (@tbl:behaviours), which was higher than the 30.8% in Miller's (2007) review. However, the implementation of mortality varied across the models, and the most common mortality function used was a linear function (82.2%), thus a fixed percentage of the larvae were killed each day. The mean linear mortality rate used was 19.4%, ranging from 1.7% to 30.0%. Other mortality implementations were to kill the larvae based on a known temperature or salinity threshold (7.9%), using a decay function that decreased mortality based on age (7.9%) or using a Weibull function (2.1%). Unlike in Miller's 2007 review, where growth was implemented in one-third of the studies, only 6% of the models reviewed had the ability for larvae to grow (@tbl:behaviours). The rationale is that the models used in this review are solely investigating connectivity, where growth is not considered such an important factor affecting the strength of connectivity amongst sites, unless it is co-implemented with a sinking velocity dependent on mass.

#### Movement behaviours

The degree to which larvae can behave, specifically sense, orient and swim directionally (vertically or horizontally) is a fundamental concern in broader field of larval biology which has potentially important ramifications for connectivity. As discussed previously, this has been recognised in the world of BDMs, with general support for the inclusion of such behaviours. In this review, we classified models according to which of the four major larval behaviours were implemented; no movement (passive movement), movement (e.g. horizontal or vertical swimming), orientation (ability to orientate towards a reef using cues) and settlement (settle at a site using a sensory buffer or sticky zones).

Larvae were given the ability to move in 25.9% of the models, conversely in 74% of the models the larvae were assumed to be passive and moved solely using the physical model. Miller (2007) observed that 43% of the fish studies in the reviewed papers implemented a facet of larval behaviour, thus the percentage of BDM studies implementing larval behaviour is decreasing. Of the behaviours classified as movement, diel vertical migration was the most commonly implemented behaviour (45.4%; @tbl:swimming). Ontogenetic vertical migration, the idea that marine species change their vertical position in the water column as a factor of their ontogeny, was used in 27.2% of the models. Horizontal swimming was implemented in 12.5% of the models, although it must be mentioned that random movement to mimic turbulence does capture an extent of undirected horizontal swimming. A smaller number implemented vertical swimming in the larvae (4.5%). Other movements included in models were prompted by environmental conditions such as tides (circatidal migration; 5.7%), salinity (halocline migration; 1.1%), or migrating with the pycnocline (6.8%). Another movement implementation, as mentioned above, was using sinking velocity (3.4%) in conjunction with growth, e.g. the heavier the larvae the faster it sinks. The last strategy involved giving the pelagic eggs a buoyancy (4.5%) based on the salinity level in the water column, thus they can float at different vertical migrations.

|--------------------------------|:---------------:|
| Diel vertical migration        |      45.4       |
| Ontogenetic vertical migration |      27.2       |

| Egg buoyancy                   |       4.5       |
| Sinking velocity               |       3.4       |
| Halocline migration            |       1.1       |

The ability of the marine larvae to sense settlement habitat was implemented in 50.9% of the models. Of these, 95.4% opted for a buffer zone implementation, where each settlement site has a buffer added to it, increasing its size. The mean size of the buffer zone was 8.18 km (SD = 5.2 km). The other implementation, which essentially works on similar principles, was to give the larvae a detection distance relative to the centre of the settlement site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. This settlement cue was used to allow the larvae to orientate towards the reef if the larvae was within the cue distance ranging between 1-10 km (median distance was 5 km), with a combination of early and late onset orientating abilities.

We compared the modelling of behaviours between two taxa groups, fish and invertebrates, for the reason that fish tend to have move swimming behaviour implemented based on their biology (ignoring generic taxa and non-animal models). For the both models, approximately half of the models each year implemented only passive larvae (@fig:comparisons). Although the trend for fish looked to be downward, while the trend for invertebrates appeared to be upward, peaking in 2014 at 70% (@fig:comparisons (d)). The proportion of fish BDMs implementing movement increased over time, overtaking the proportion of passive studies in 2016 (@fig:comparisons (c)). For BDMs parameterising invertebrates, there was no year where more models implemented movement behaviours instead of passive larvae, with a low of 23% of models in 2014. Orientated swimming was only implemented in the fish models, and this only occurred in 2012. For both fish and invertebrates, the proportion of models implementing the ability to sense settlement habitat remained constant, although this proportion was about twice as high for fish models ((@fig:comparisons (c, d)).

The behaviours are passive = passive movement of the larvae; movement = the ability of the larvae to move, settlement = larvae can sense suitable habitats for settlement; and orientation = larvae can orientate and move towards settlement habitats.](../figs/comparisons.png){#fig:comparisons}

This finding is interesting from a biological viewpoint. There is growing empirical knowledge of larval fish behaviour influencing the outcome of connectivity [@Leis:2006kf; @Cowen:2009fm], and also BDM studies demonstrating that connectivity changes with the implementation of behaviour, suggesting the way forward is to include behaviour in connectivity models [@Staaterman:2014ee; @North:2009tx]. Despite this, the results show the majority of studies are not including any behaviour at all in their models (@fig:comparisons); 73.9% of models implemented passive larvae. There is also a well-established body of empirical literature which highlights the often-extensive swimming abilities of ichthyoplankton [@Leis:2006kf; @Leis2010325]. Even where horizontal swimming is not considered biologically important, it is well understood zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration patterns, migrating below the mixed layer, hypothesised due to predator avoidance [@Lampert:1989ww]. The important of vertical position is that the larvae is exposed to different current velocities (differing in magnitude and direction) at different depths in the water column. Several studies in the review showed that vertical migration (either diel or ontogenetic) increased self-recruitment and limit the dispersal kernel [@Young:2012gb; @Aiken:2011fx]. Orientation was only implemented in a small number of models, yet there is an increasing body of research in the last decade regarding the ability of reef fish larvae to orientate towards natal reefs using olfactory mechanisms [@Gerlach:2007gw], celestial cues [@Leis:2014es; @Faillettaz:2015dn] and a magnetic compass [@Bottesch:2016hl].

One possible reason for not implementing behaviour is that the complete (or even partial) early life history is often unknown for many species and researchers are trying to avoid using any behavioural assumptions in their models. Fish larval behaviour is known to be species specific, yet many models are limited to using known data from the family taxonomic level due to the lack of specific knowledge for the species of interest. It has been argued that this approach is fraught with danger, as behaviour can vary widely amongst species within a family taxonomic grouping [@Leis2010325]. This lack of species specific knowledge poses the question, can we only model species where we fully understand the early life history, or is there a degree of assumption that is deemed to still be scientifically valid to answer the study question. It also emphasises the empirical work that is still required to better understand fish early-life history.

### The metrics used to describe connectivity

There were more than 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of dispersal and settlement amongst the models. The common approaches were to use combinations of dispersal kernels (64.0%) and connectivity matrices (57.2%; @tbl:common_metrics). Less common measures of model output were analysis using graph theory (8.1%), larval centre of mass (average geographical position of the larvae; 2.6%) [@Lacroix:2013cf; @Miyake:2011hr], isotropy (describes the inertia around the centre of mass; 1.3%) [@Ayata201018], positive area (number of areas that had larvae in them, 1.3%) [@Puckett:2014cx], and proportion of sites settled (1.3%) [@Robins:2013ih].

| Graph theory        |                         |   **8.1**    |

The trend in biophysical modelling is to present data using visual techniques such as heat maps, which while being effective tools for visually communicating complex patterns qualitatively, they are not amenable to the extraction of exact metric values. The most common connectivity values reported in the the reviewed studies–when a connectivity matrix was presented–were self-recruitment (39.9%), local retention (35.3%) and global settlement success of larvae (23.9%; @tbl:common_metrics). However, while these response metrics were explicitly described, we were only able to extract actual values from 70.0%, 62.0%, and 42.0% of the studies in which connectivity matrices were described for self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success respectively.

Based on the extracted data, there was a large spread of the mean self-recruitment amongst the models, ranging from 0-98%, depending on the study, with a median self-recruitment percentage of 13.0%. Local retention, while mentioned in 31.7% of studies, was only available for 5.5% of the model, with mean values ranging between 0.3% to 46.0% and a median of 6.0%. Mean settlement success of the larvae (available for 18.0% of the studies), ranged from 0.1% to 80.0% successful settlement rates, with a median of 17.0%. Mean dispersal distance (available from 15.2% of the studies) had with a median value of 78.2 km (range of 9.1 - 952 km).

The high percentage of successfully settled larvae per model comes across as unusually high for connectivity models. It was expected that the settlement success would be extremely low, even if mortality is not included in the system. Perhaps because many studies have reported potential connectivity instead of realised connectivity (realised is a more accurate measure offset by biological processes such as egg production and mortality). The large ranges for the metrics of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success, was also unexpected. However, the large range of input parameters must be responsible for such variations - in the next section we explore how these modelling decisions affect these common metrics.

Influence of modelling decisions on connectivity values
-------------------------------------------------------

As indicated above, much of the variation observed in connectivity values and patterns across the reviewed studies will be driven by modelling environments, specifically parameter decisions. Here we attempt to use the body of reviewed literature to assess the impact of various model and parameter choices on resulting connectivity values. We have restricted consideration to only those model characteristics/input parameters and output connectivity metrics that were shared amongst the majority of studies, as described in the methods section. Specifically, we look at the impact of four characteristics of modelling environment (choice of model, model resolution, model design and study system) and four biological parameterisation decisions (larval duration, competency window, larval mortality and movement behaviour) on the key common metrics of connectivity (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success & dispersal distance). Note there are situations where there were not enough data points to make valid comparison of specific connectivity metrics and there are uneven sample sizes between the groups.

### Modelling environment

#### Model choice

There is no clear effect of either BDM or physical model choice on the resulting connectivity metrics (see Supplementary Materials S1). For example for the BDMs, the Connectivity Modelling System (CMS) had consistent reported values of self-recruitment between studies, but variable settlement success. Studies using HYCOM and POM had the largest ranges amongst the metrics. ROMS and HANSOM had the least variation of metrics for the common hydrodynamic models.

### Model resolution

There was a significant positive predictive relationship between the resolution of the hydrodynamic model and local retention (r^2^ = 0.82, F(1,17) = 79.11, p \< 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel), but no relationship between model resolution and the other metrics of self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.05, F(1,57) = 2.75, p > 0.05), settlement success (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,64) = 0.77, p > 0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,51) = 0.69, p > 0.05). This was unexpected, given that the increased resolution captures more sub-mesoscale processes to influence the trajectory of the larvae, e.g. increasing self-recruitment as small eddies trap larvae close to natal reefs. Local retention increases as model resolution gets coarser, which is difficult to explain in absence of no relationship with self-recruitment or settlement success and model resolution.

![METRICS PANEL](../figs/metrics_panel.png){#fig:metrics_panel}

#### Nesting hydrodynamic models

The self-recruitment at natal sites was significantly reduced (28.8% versus 0.9%) when using multiple hydrodynamic models (i.e. sub-models with higher resolution to capture coastal dynamics; t=7.15, df=49.13, p\<0.05). However, caution should be used when evaluating this result due to the large unbalance between the groups (only 10 models describing self-recruitment had nested designs versus 50 which did not). There was no significant difference in the settlement success or dispersal distance when using nested models, and there were no studies using nested models where we were able to get local retention values. Again, the results are not as hypothesised, as increasing resolution to capture coastal dynamics theoretically increases self-recruitment and local retention, while lowering the dispersal distance.

### Open systems vs closed systems

There was no evidence that the geographic openness of the ocean system being modelled was consistently affecting the connectivity results derived from the models. While both self-recruitment and settlement success (38% and 22% higher respectively) were greater in a closed system, the difference was not significant (self-recruitment: t = 1.24, df = 16.49, p > 0.05; settlement success: t = 0.97, df = 64, p > 0.05). This result is also unexpected given the presumably elevated rates of larval loss in open systems, but it should be noted that the samples sizes here are small. Of course, this lack of difference could also be indicative of researchers appropriately choosing the boundaries of the modelled systems based on the biology of the modelled taxa. In this case, even seemingly open systems, may in fact be demographically closed ones. Dispersal distance was 3.4 times greater in open systems, compared to closed (t = -3.75, df = 41.82, p \< 0.05). This can be explained by the geographical nature of an open system, potentially allowing more larvae to be dispersed away from settlement sites and into large oceanic features. There were not enough data points on local retention for a meaningful comparison.

### Biological parameterisation

#### Pelagic larval duration

Local retention to the natal site showed a significant positive relationship with the length of PLD (r^2^ = 0.57, F(1,16) = 20.95, p \< 0.05), although this relationship is based on limited data (n=18). There was no relationship with either self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.02, F(1,54) = 1.12, p > 0.05) or settlement success (r^2^ = 0.05, F(1,59) = 3.08, p > 0.05). Dispersal distance also had no strong relationship with PLD (r^2^ = 0.02, F(1,43) = 1.10, p > 0.05). This is supported by studies that have shown there is no easily defined relationship between dispersal distance and PLD [@Mora:2012kn], although other studies have found a positive relationship [@Corell:2012id]; which is the intuitive result).

#### Settlement competency window

The settlement competency window, dependent on the pelagic larval duration, was strongly negatively correlated with local retention (r^2^ = 0.70, F(1,9) = 20.83, p \< 0.05) and weakly positively correlated with self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.27, F(1,18) = 6.69, p \< 0.05). The was no significant relationship with settlement success (r^2^ = 0.09, F(1,24) = 2.39, p > 0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^ = 0.04, F(1,19) = 0.75, p > 0.05). One would assume a greater competency window size would enhance opportunities for successful settlement and to do so over a greater distance. Thus the lack of effect here is surprising, though it is possible any observable relationships are masked by the impact of parameterisation decisions made by these models which may have stronger effects on settlement success (e.g. mortality, see below). The strong tendency for models with longer window sizes to have lower self-recruitment is seemingly contradictory. However, as this increased window size will affect individuals at later stages of the larval period only, any larvae old enough to benefit from the extended window are potentially further from the natal site, and thus less expected to contribute to self-recruitment.

#### Mortality

Models which included mortality had similar levels of self-recruitment (t = -1.54, df = 58, p > 0.05) and settlement success (t = 0.70, df = 64, p > 0.05) to models run without mortality (@fig:mortality_metrics). Including mortality also had no effect on the dispersal distance of the marine larvae (t = -1.16, df = 9.13, p > 0.05). There was a significant difference in local retention when mortality was applied (t = -3.65, df = 4.30, p \< 0.05). Mortality did reduce the variation of the settlement success and the dispersal distance (apart from two outliers), which is an expected result. The variation of self-recruitment values increased, which would occur if settlement success also decreased, as less larvae would be arriving from other sites.

![Comparing models that implemented mortality with the metrics of self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance (km)](../figs/mortality.png){#fig:mortality}

#### Movement behaviours

The inclusion of orientated swimming and combining orientated swimming with the ability to sense settlement sites produced significantly lower self-recruitment than if the larvae were given the ability to move (*find out how to report lsmeans*; @fig:behaviours). The was no significant difference in self-recruitment if you included movement, settlement sensory or a combination of the two over passive behaviour. This was an unexpected result, as stated above, previous studies have shown behaviour to increase self-recruitment. While the non-significant result might be driven by outliers, movement and settlement both produce lower self-recruitment than passive larvae. The few data points for local retention showed no difference between passive or moving larvae. Previous work has shown that local retention was increased when vertical migration strategies were included in the model [@Robins:2013ih]. Settlement success was is highest, increasing by more than a factor of two, when both movement and settlement are included in the model, significantly different from passive larvae, moving larvae and settlement sensing larvae (@fig:behaviours). Orientation had high variation in settlement success and reduced this increase when combined with settlement sensing, but it was still significantly different from the settlement success of passive larvae. Individual studies have shown orientation to increase settlement success [@Staaterman:2012ek], the differences are assumed to be in the small number of models that implemented orientation. It was surprising there was mo difference between the settlement success of moving and passive particles, it has been shown movement to increase the settlement success [@Aiken:2011fx]. Dispersal distance was significantly reduced with the inclusion of orientated swimming and combining orientated swimming with the ability to sense settlement sites, than if the larvae were only given the ability to move (*find out how to report lsmeans*; @fig:behaviours). The was no significant difference in dispersal if you included movement, settlement sensory or a combination of the two over passive behaviour. This was not an unexpected result, as previous studies have shown either behaviour to limit the dispersal of pelagic larvae [@Butler:2011wu] or for vertical movement to increase dispersal distance [@Corell:2012id], suggesting interactions with other parameters are involved.

Conclusion and recommendations
------------------------------

(Trend towards implementing behaviour)
The popularity of BDMs as a connectivity research tool has been on a downward trend since 2012. However, the implementation of these models are getting more complex, especially for ichthyoplankton, where 2016 marked the first time a majority of BDMs implemented larval movement behaviours. The proportion of studies using settlement sensory strategies was consistent across the review period for models of either fish or invertebrate species, not keeping up with the trend seen in implementing movement. Researchers appear to be heeding the recommendations of publications such as the ICES manual and other research showing the importance of movement in influencing connectivity patterns. Form a biological viewpoint this is encouraging, as it is in keeping with the research showing that biology matters in dispersal.

(Surprising amount of variability in the metrics data)
The large variation seen in both the model inputs and the connectivity metrics produced from these BDMs was unexpected. Variability of metrics is most likely driven due to the non-trivial number of parameter choices made, both physical and biological, in BDMs, many of which are optional or species specific. There is a grey area when determining what information to include in a model and what level of accuracy and precision is required for biological inputs.

(No obvious (or easy) patterns between parameter choice and metrics)
The current state of the field gives the impression it is not moving forward as coherently it should be in the eight years since the ICES manual of recommended practices was published [@North:2009tx]. A significant reason for this is the absence of published data on the early-life history of many marine species, highlighting a key area of required future research. Without data, it is difficult to justify introduce behaviour into models, as robust models aim to minimise assumptions. This review has also highlighted the lack of unity in both input parameters and metrics to describe the output of the BDMs. There appears to be no consensus on what biological parameters to choose when implementing a model, i.e. what behaviours are required in a BDM to accurately estimate the connectivity for a reef fish species. BDMs are non-trivial models, making it difficult to standardise the output in order to produce simple comparisons. Although agreement about common metrics and consistent metrics reporting would help alleviate some of these issues. Standardisation of metrics will also assist in validating the estimated patterns of connectivity with empirical studies (e.g. genetic studies, comparisons long-term known recruitment data and other techniques where appropriate), providing important model validation. Model validation should be an ultimate goal of BDM studies, especially as understanding connectivity is a central tenet of designing marine reserves [@Almany:2009io, @Bode:2016bq].

(More model validation required!)
In conclusion, we believe in order for this field to progress further, we need to better understand the relative importance of different behaviours of connectivity for ichthyoplankton and other marine families (potentially species/taxa specific). This understanding will us to generate baseline models for connectivity and highlight areas of knowledge gaps in early-life history that need to be addressed so we can confidently parametrise these BDMs and generate better outcomes.
