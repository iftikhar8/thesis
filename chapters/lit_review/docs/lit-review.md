Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) has been used to investigate marine dispersal patterns for three decades [@Bartsch:1988vg] â€” increasingly utilised in the last 10-15 years to estimate marine larval connectivity. BDMs produce potential patterns of connectivity using a physical (i.e. hydrodynamic) model, coupled with a biological model, encapsulating the biology of a marine species, to move the particles within the physical system [@Cowen:2009fm]. These models lend themselves to studies inferring distributional patterns for marine species with two distinct life stages, pelagic larval and contrasting sedentary adult phase. BDMs allow us to investigate questions that are inherently difficult to ask *in situ* [@Cowen:2009fm], from allowing us to investigate potential connectivity patterns over wide spatial scales [@Andrello:2013cc; @Treml:2015bt] and long temporal scales [@Richar:2014cg; @Berglund:2012cr]; to investigating how different early-life history traits (e.g. spawning times, diel migration, and swimming abilities) affect connectivity patterns [@Butler:2011wu; @Staaterman:2012ek].

Complexity and realism in BDMs has increased progressively; likely driven in part by both reduced costs of high performance computing, and increasing open access to high resolution oceanographic flow models and dispersal models. Basic research is also fuelling this trend, as studies are increasingly demonstrating the nektonic ability of pelagic marine larvae [@Leis2010325]. [@Miller:2007iu] evinced this trend in the review of ichthyoplankton biophysical modelling (referred to by Miller as individual-level, coupled physical-biological models), where 43.3% of studies implemented behaviour, predominately age-dependent vertical migration behaviour. This increased focus on the importance of the biology in BDMs has led to important insights about the role of larval behaviour in dispersal. Spawning behaviour (along with the location of the natal site) influences dispersal patterns [@Puckett:2014cx], and vertical movement of larval fish increases retention near the natal site and affect connectivity patterns [@Paris:2004te; @Brochier:2008hd; @Robins:2013ih; @Paris:2007hm]. Horizontal swimming has not been specifically included in BDMs (commonly implemented as a random walk) to the same extent as vertical migration, although combined with the ability for larvae to orientate towards a source, it is expected to influence larval connectivity patterns [@Leis:2007jh]. Directed swimming towards swimming towards settlement sites increases settlement success, including settlement at or near the natal site [@Staaterman:2012ek; @Wolanski:2014eb]. From empirical studies, we know larval fish can achieve considerable swimming speeds, potentially giving the ability to out-swim the surrounding current, and it improves with growth [@Leis:2006kf].

This previous work has made it clear that the biological components of BDMs can strongly affect connectivity patterns; and this emphasis has been recognised in the ICES publication, "Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life", which recommends their inclusion and provides implementation guidance for researchers [@North:2009tx]. Larval behaviour is prominent in published BDM tools, such as the Connectivity Modelling System [CMS; @Paris:2013fs] & Connie3 (<http://www.csiro.au/connie/>). But despite this increasing attention paid to the importance of the biological model, there remains little consensus on the relative importance of different biological parameters. For BDMs to be a robust tool in understanding the connectivity of marine populations, such a consensus is ultimately required. Considerable context dependence to the relative importance of some biological parameters may exist (i.e. the importance of horizontal swimming may depend on the strength of the flow regime or the length of the larval period), while the inclusion of others may always make a large difference to the resulting connectivity patterns.

In this study, we review the recent literature on BDMs to evaluate the ability of this collective body of work to provide insight into the ramifications of the choices we make when attempting to include complexity and realism in our models. We achieve this aim by firstly evaluating if the field is progressing in its inclusion of biological parameters. We look at the collection of parameters included in BDMs, how this is changing over time, and if there are trends in how parameters are included (or excluded) based on the context of models. We define a model as a distinct collection of parameters for a BDM, and a study as a published collection of one or more models. Secondly, and most importantly, we look at the ramifications of the inclusion of different parameters on model results. Here we assess if there are observable differences in key metrics of connectivity as a result of the inclusion of specific biological parameters. We also assess the degree to which the physical context of the models regulate any observed effect of biological parameters. This information will serve to guide the application of BDMs into the future and by highlighting the ramifications of the inclusion/exclusion of key biological parameters. It will also identify gaps in our implementation of these parameters which should serve to identify necessary empirical work needed to address these shortcomings.

Methods

### Literature search

We searched for relevant studies using the keywords; connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. We found 75 studies (with 367 models) matching these criteria, published in 35 journals (see the full list of references and the data extracted in the supplementary materials). We constrained the search to publications from 2009, as this was the publication date of the ICES manual recommending the way forward for biophysical connectivity models [@North:2009tx], and also close to the date of the last review in this area [@Miller:2007iu]. Whilst our primary research interest was the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton, we included connectivity studies modelling other marine species with a pelagic larval stage and sedentary adult phase (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and corals), owing to often negligible differences in parameterised behaviours.

### Data classification

Most studies performed connectivity simulations using variations of their BDM, involving different input values for one or more parameters. This was often undertaken to test the effect of different parameters (representing different species/taxa or variations in behaviours of the same species/taxa) on resulting connectivity patterns. In this review, we separately identify each of these scenarios within a study and refer to each as a model.

We characterised each model within a study according to a variety of traits, which are broadly grouped into four themes. The first theme looked at context and the physical model, and how that was parameterised, e.g. information such as the location, particle tracking software, and hydrodynamic model used. To see if there was an effect of the modelled geographical area on settlement, the regions were broadly categorised into open (coastal, island) or closed (bay or inland sea). The second theme considered the larval trait parameters such as pelagic larval duration, settlement competency, spawning times, mortality, growth and behaviours, e.g. vertical migration. The length of the settlement competency window was determined as the time-period between larvae was first allowed to settle and the end of the pelagic larval duration. The third theme considered the metrics used to measure the connectivity patterns of the model and their specific values. In-excess of 20 different metrics were used to describe the patterns of connectivity predicted from BDMs. Several metrics were common amongst studies (i.e. dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices), while others were unique to a study. These metrics can be broadly categorised into two related classes. The first class included those metrics which summarised the dispersal kernel (mean, variance directionality) while the second captured metrics which identified connectivity pathways more explicitly (self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success; defined in @tbl:definitions). Specific values for every metric were not available from every study, and where possible, values were extracted from figures using the software package GraphClick (version 3.0.3; <http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/>).

### Data analysis

To address our aim of evaluating the application of biology in BDMs, we summarised model characteristics from our first three themes and evaluated their relative occurrence and how this have changed over time. To address our aim of identifying the importance of including biological parameters on different metrics of connectivity as well as the context dependence of any such relationships, we compared each of the most commonly reported connectivity metrics (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance) amongst models including certain parameters. Due to differences in the metrics reported or obtained from studies, there is considerable variation in the samples sizes for each metric. We required there be at least five studies for a given metric within a parameter group to conduct a comparison. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships of metrics and continuous model parameters and Student or Welch's t-tests (checking for equal variance using Bartlett's test) were used for comparisons between the metrics and categorical model parameters. We conducted all data analysis using the R programming language version 3.3.2 [@RAlanguageanden:wf].

Current trends in biophysical connectivity modelling
----------------------------------------------------

There was an initial increase in the number of studies per year over the review period, which peaked in 2012 (20 studies) and steadily declined from then on (@fig:years). There was a mean of 10.7 BDM studies per year â€” the last eight years of Miller's (2007) review averaged of 6.6 studies, demonstrating the increased prevalence of BDM studies as a research tool. In this section, we explore the current trends in both input parameters and output metrics of connectivity studies, using the four model characteristic themes of model context, biological model parameters, and the metrics of connectivity used.

![The number of biophysical dispersal modelling studies by publication year that were included in the review](../figs/years.png){#fig:years}

### The model context

Most of the connectivity studies used an existing BDM (85.3%), the rest either built a BDM to answer the study question (13.3%) or specific information about the BDM was missing from the methods (1.3%). This high model reuse suggests an increasing confidence in the model output and ease of adoption for end-users â€” both essential for maturing the field. Twenty-one different BDMs were used amongst the studies, although we were unable to identify the exact particle tracking model used for 22.7% of the studies. The three most popular BDMs used amongst the reviewed studies were Ichthyop [18.7%; @Lett:2008fo], CMS [12.0%; @Paris:2013fs], and MGET [8.0%; @Roberts:2010df]. The studies all used forecasting for their models, except for one hindcast solution, where the larvae are initially tracked from settlement sites to determine their natal sites [@Wren:2016gu]. The most popular hydrodynamic models used were ROMS (25.3%), the HYCOM (18.7%), and MARS3D (10.7%). @Miller:2007iu showed in their review the majority of studies used FEM (20%) or HANSOM (12.9%) and ROMS in 7.1% of studies. It shows a trend towards open-source models in recent years. The mean resolution of the hydrodynamic models was 4.7 km^2^, ranging from finest [50 m^2^; @Brennan:2014fm] to coarsest [33 km^2^; @Crochelet:2013kr]. In @Miller:2007iu the mean resolution was twice as coarse (10.8 km^2^). Some BPMs used nested hydrodynamic models (16.0%), to bypass issues of low resolution near coastal areas in modelling by using specific regional models. The hydrodynamic models covered 20 different oceanographic regions across the world, of which two studies investigated connectivity patterns at a global scale. As observed in @Miller:2007iu, modelling effort concentrated on highly industrialised fishing regions (i.e. the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea), and two-thirds were in temperate regions. Although, the number of studies in tropical regions increased to 32.9%, up from the 4.0% in @Miller:2007iu. The early-life histories of tropical marine species are commonly researched, and thus increased focus on tropical connectivity patterns is not unexpected.

The studies used different time-scales of oceanographic data depending on the connectivity questions asked (inter- or intra-annual). Although studies trended towards running the BDM over several years (median = 3 years), one-third used a single year (31.1%). One study used yearly average input data to interpret mean connectivity patterns [@Feutry:2013je], accounting for variation, while also reducing the runtime of the model. Other outliers included studies investigating climate change scenarios, which used periods of 60 years [@Aiken:2011fx] and 130 years [@Andrello:2014ge]. Not all studies used a continuous period for the hydrodynamic forcing, choosing instead to use a suite of specific years. As high-powered computing becomes more readily available and with the known variability between consecutive years in hydrodynamic modelling, the trend for BDMs should be towards using longer periods of ocean data as input, though there is little evidence for this trend over the past 20 years based on @Miller:2007iu and this review. It is important that models strive to include longer time frames, as this allows for inter-annual comparisons of connectivity patterns and accounts for natural variation in currents.

### How connectivity studies are parametrising the biological model

Ten marine taxonomic groups, and one generic group, were identified from models parametrised using 47 specific species and seven family level characteristics (@fig:taxa). The generic taxonomic group, applied in situations where a model used biological parameters that are applicable to multiple species, e.g. a specified pelagic larval duration. The most common taxonomic group was fish (41.3%; @fig:taxa), with the number of ichthyoplankton BDMs that were published each year consistent to that reported by @Miller:2007iu study. Generic species were the second most common, used in 38.0% of the models, although one study used 99 models (27.0% of the total models analysed in the review) implementing a suite of generic parameters [@Treml:2015bt].

![The identified taxonomic groups that were used to parameterised the biological model used in the BDM studies, from either species or family level attributes. The generic taxonomic group refers to models that used parameters values which were not specifically tied to a species, but rather could be shared across numerous species](../figs/taxa.png){#fig:taxa}

The biological parameters implemented were not consistent across studies, apart from: pelagic larval duration (PLD; 99.2%) and spawning behaviour (92.9% - as mentioned previously there was a single hindcast study where spawning timing is not applicable; @tbl:behaviours). These traits are fundamental to connectivity studies for marine larvae and these results were expected. The lack of consistent implementation of other traits and behaviours could be attributed to a lack of concern that biology strongly influences patterns of connectivity. Given the recent publications acknowledging the influence of behaviour on connectivity patterns however, itâ€™s probably reasonable to attribute this pattern to gaps in biological knowledge about the early-life history of many marine species which makes biological parametrisation uncertain.

| Functionality                | Implemented (%) |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Pelagic larval duration      | 99.2            |
| Spawning strategies          | 92.9            |
| Sensory ability              | 50.8            |
| Settlement competency window | 49.7            |
| Mortality                    | 38.0            |
| Movement                     | 29.1            |
| Orientation              | 7.1             |
| Growth                       | 6.3             |


The pelagic larval durations (PLD) values ranged from 2-420 days, with a median of 30 days. The PLDs were taken from published values for species or taxonomic family where available, with the longest PLDs occurring for invertebrate species e.g. the long duration (~400 days) for the phyllosoma larval stage of lobsters [@Butler:2011wu; @Kough:2013fa]. PLDs, about half the time, were used in conjunction with a settlement competency window (46.8%; @tbl:behaviours). The settlement competency window gives the marine larvae a period in which they are too young to settle, hence they become competent after a defined period. It is based on their known biology, where possible, incorporating the hypothesis that larvae must sufficiently develop morphological features before the pelagic larval stage can finish. The median start date when the larvae were considered developed enough to settle was nine days.

The spawning strategy was dependent on the biology of the modelled taxa and included pelagic eggs, demersal eggs, or brooding; implemented by changing the depth for the release of the larvae, e.g. demersal eggs were released on the bottom of the natal reef and pelagic eggs were released higher up the water column. The timing of when larvae were released varied from hourly intervals [@Jacobi:2012cz], daily [@Kough:2013fa], monthly [@Staaterman:2012ek], on lunar cycles [@Davies:2014cw] or a one-off spawning event [@Herbert:2011bh]. Typically, the spawning events were pre-determined, but several studies using variable release times initiated by ocean temperature [@Andrello:2014ge; @Rochette:2012io] or wave height â€” used by one study to spawn abalone larvae [@Miyake:2011hr]. The number of release and settlement sites were different for half of the studies (50.5%), often using a limited set of release sites with more available settlement sites to investigate the connectivity from known spawning areas. The number of larvae spawned varied considerably at each release site (10-10,000,000 larvae). The total larvae tracked in the system (spawning site multiplied by the number of sites, multiplied by the number of releases) had a similarly extended range of 328 in total to a sizeable 610 million, with a median of 2.4 million.

Larval mortality was implemented in only 40.2% of the models (@tbl:behaviours), which was higher than the 30.8% in Miller's (2007) review. However, the implementation of mortality varied across the models, and the most common mortality function used was a linear function (82.1%), thus a fixed percentage of the larvae were killed each day. The mean linear mortality rate used was 19.0%, ranging from 1.7% to 30.0%. Other mortality implementations were to kill the larvae based on a known temperature or salinity threshold (7.9%), using a decay function that decreased mortality based on age (7.9%) or using a Weibull function (2.1%). Unlike in Miller's 2007 review, where growth was implemented in one-third of the studies, only a small number of the models reviewed had the ability for larvae to grow (@tbl:behaviours). The rationale is that the models used in this review are solely investigating connectivity, where growth is not considered such an important factor affecting the strength of connectivity amongst sites, unless it is co-implemented with a sinking velocity dependent on mass.

The degree to which larvae can behave, specifically sense, orient and swim directionally (vertically or horizontally) is a fundamental concern in broader field of larval biology which has potentially important ramifications for connectivity. As discussed previously, this has been recognised in the world of BDMs, with general support for the inclusion of such behaviours. In this review, we classified models according to which of the four-major larval behaviours were implemented; no movement (passive movement), movement (e.g. horizontal or vertical swimming), orientation (ability to orientate towards a reef using sensory cues) and settlement (settle at a site using a sensory buffer or sticky zones). Larvae were given the ability to move in 29.1% of the models (@tbl:behaviours), conversely in 70.7% of the models the larvae were assumed to be passive and moved solely using the physical model. Miller (2007) observed that 43% of the fish studies in the reviewed papers implemented some movement behaviour, thus the percentage of BDM studies implementing larval behaviour is decreasing. Of the behaviours classified as movement, diel vertical migration was the most commonly implemented behaviour (41.1%). Ontogenetic vertical migration, the idea that marine species change their vertical position in the water column as a factor of their ontogeny, was used in 26.2% of the models. Horizontal swimming was implemented in 26.2% of the models, although it must be mentioned that random walks to mimic turbulence does encapsulate undirected horizontal swimming. A smaller number implemented vertical swimming in the larvae (4.7%). Some other movements included in models were prompted by environmental conditions such as tides (circatidal migration; 5.6%), salinity (halocline migration; 0.9%), or migrating with the pycnocline (5.6%). The ability of the marine larvae to sense settlement habitat was implemented in 50.8% of the models (@tbl:behaviours). The common approach was to implement a buffer or sticky zone around the settlement site (87.1%). The mean size of this sensory zone was 8.3 (Â± 5.2) km. The other implementation gave the larvae a detection distance relative to the the settlement site [@Staaterman:2012ek, @Wolanski:2014eb]. This settlement cue was used to allow the larvae to orientate towards, and thus swim in the direction of the reef if the larvae was within the cue distance ranging between 1-10 km (mean distance was 3.5 km), with a combination of early and late onset orientating abilities.

We compared the modelling of behaviours between two taxa groups, fish and invertebrates, for the reason that fish tend to have move swimming behaviour implemented based on their biology (ignoring generic taxa and non-animal models).
Surprisingly movement was more consistently implemented in invertebrate models than fish, where 2010 and 2011 only had passive models with settlement (@fig:comparisons A, B). The proportion of fish models with passive larvae trended downwards over the course of the review, with movement included in more than half of all models in 2016 (@fig:comparisons C). For invertebrates, the proportions of actively moving to passive larvae was consistently equal or slightly fewer, except for 2014, when the majority were passive moving studies (@fig:comparisons D). Orientated swimming was only implemented in the fish models, and in low numbers (@fig:comparisons A). For both fish and invertebrates, the proportion of models implementing the ability to sense settlement habitat remained constant, although this proportion was higher in fish models (@fig:comparisons C, D).

The behaviours are passive = passive movement of the larvae; movement = the ability of the larvae to move, settlement = larvae can sense suitable habitats for settlement using a "sticky" zone; and orientation = larvae can orientate and swim towards settlement habitats.](../figs/comparisons.png){#fig:comparisons}

There is growing empirical knowledge of larval fish behaviour influencing the outcome of connectivity [@Leis:2006kf; @Cowen:2009fm], and also BDM studies demonstrating that connectivity changes with the implementation of behaviour, suggesting the way forward is to include behaviour in connectivity models [@Staaterman:2014ee; @North:2009tx]. Therefore, this finding is interesting from a biological viewpoint, as the results show the majority of studies are not including any behaviour at all in their models; 73.9% of models implemented passive larvae, although it must be noted this trend was decreasing for ichthyoplankton BDMs (less than a quarter used passive larvae in 2016, @fig:comparisons C). There is also a well-established body of empirical literature which highlights the often-extensive swimming abilities of ichthyoplankton [@Leis:2006kf; @Leis2010325]. Even where horizontal swimming is not considered biologically important, it is well understood zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration patterns, migrating below the mixed layer, hypothesised due to predator avoidance [@Lampert:1989ww]. The important of vertical position is that the larvae are exposed to different current velocities (differing in magnitude and direction) at different depths in the water column. Several studies in the review showed that vertical migration (either diel or ontogenetic) increased self-recruitment and limit the dispersal kernel [@Young:2012gb; @Aiken:2011fx]. Orientation was only implemented in a small number of models, yet there is an increasing body of research in the last decade regarding the ability of reef fish larvae to orientate towards natal reefs using olfactory mechanisms [@Gerlach:2007gw], celestial cues [@Leis:2014es; @Faillettaz:2015dn] and a magnetic compass [@Bottesch:2016hl].

One possible reason for not implementing behaviour is that the complete (or even partial) early life history is often unknown for many species and researchers are trying to avoid using any behavioural assumptions in their models. Fish larval behaviour is known to be species specific, yet many models are limited to using known data from the family taxonomic level due to the lack of specific knowledge for the species of interest. It has been argued that this approach is fraught with danger, as behaviour can vary widely amongst species within a family taxonomic grouping [@Leis2010325]. This lack of species specific knowledge poses the question, can we only model species where we fully understand the early life history, or is there a degree of assumption that is deemed to still be scientifically valid to answer the study question. It also emphasises the empirical work that is still required to better understand fish early-life history.

### The metrics used to describe connectivity

There were more than 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of dispersal and settlement amongst the models. The three main approaches were to use combinations of dispersal kernels (70.7%), connectivity matrices (realised or potential; 52.2%) and graph theory (32.1%). Less common measures of model output were analysis using larval centre of mass (average geographical position of the larvae) [@Lacroix:2013cf; @Miyake:2011hr], isotropy (describes the inertia around the centre of mass) [@Ayata201018], positive area (number of areas that had larvae in them) [@Puckett:2014cx], and proportion of sites settled [@Robins:2013ih].

The trend in biophysical modelling is to present data using visual techniques such as heat maps, which while being effective tools for visually communicating complex patterns qualitatively, they are not amenable to the extraction of exact metric values. When a dispersal kernel was used, 71.9% of the time, the mean dispersal distance was reported. The most common connectivity values reported in the the reviewed studiesâ€“when a connectivity matrix was presentedâ€”were local retention (55.7%), self-recruitment (55.2%), and global settlement success of larvae (36.5%). However, while these response metrics were explicitly described, we were only able to extract actual values from 80.7%, 67.7%, and 55.2% of the studies in which connectivity matrices were described for self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success respectively. Based on the extracted data, there was a large spread of the mean self-recruitment amongst the models, ranging from 0-98%, depending on the study, with a median self-recruitment percentage of 13.0%. Local retention, had mean values ranging between 0.3% to 46.0% and a median of 8.1%. Mean settlement success of the larvae (available for 18.0% of the studies), ranged from 0.1% to 80.0% successful settlement rates, with a median of 17.0%. Mean dispersal distance (available from 15.2% of the studies) had a median value of 75.6 km per larvae (range of 9-668 km).

[Flesh this paragraph out a bit]
The high percentage of successfully settled larvae per model seems atypical for connectivity models. It was expected that the settlement success overall would be low, even if mortality is not included in the system. [Why? Need to show that settlement is low because of what - keeping in mind that there are no post-settlement processes]. Perhaps because many studies have reported potential connectivity instead of realised connectivity (realised is a more accurate measure offset by biological processes such as egg production and mortality). The large ranges for the metrics of self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success, was also unexpected. However, the large range of input parameters must be responsible for such variations - in the next section we explore how these modelling decisions affect these common metrics.


Influence of modelling decisions on connectivity metrics
--------------------------------------------------------

As indicated above, much of the variation observed in connectivity values and patterns across the reviewed studies will be driven by modelling environments, specifically parameter decisions. Here we attempt to use the body of reviewed literature to assess the impact of various model and parameter choices on resulting connectivity values. We have restricted consideration to only those model characteristics/input parameters and output connectivity metrics that were shared amongst the majority of studies, as described in the methods section. Specifically, we look at the impact of four characteristics of modelling environment (choice of model, model resolution, model design and study system) and four biological parameterisation decisions (larval duration, competency window, larval mortality and movement behaviour) on the key common metrics of connectivity (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success & dispersal distance). Note there are situations where there were not enough data points to make valid comparison of specific connectivity metrics and there are uneven sample sizes between the groups.

### Modelling environment

#### Model choice

There is no clear effect of either BDM or physical model choice on the resulting connectivity metrics (see Supplementary Materials S2). For example, the Connectivity Modelling System (CMS) had consistent reported values of self-recruitment between studies, but variable settlement success. This suggests that the BDM output is related to the model input and not the implementation itself. Studies using HYCOM and POM had the largest ranges amongst the metrics. ROMS and HANSOM had the least variation of metrics for the common hydrodynamic models.
- argue that this shows individual models (particle dispersing and )

### Model resolution
- metrics panel needs all the letters
There was a significant positive predictive relationship between the resolution of the hydrodynamic model and local retention (r^2^ = 0.82, F(1,17) = 79.11, p \< 0.05; @fig:metrics_panel), but no relationship between model resolution and the other metrics of self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.05, F(1,57) = 2.75, p > 0.05), settlement success (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,64) = 0.77, p > 0.05), or dispersal distance (r^2^ = 0.01, F(1,51) = 0.69, p > 0.05). This was unexpected, given that the increased resolution captures more sub-mesoscale processes to influence the trajectory of the larvae, e.g. increasing self-recruitment as small eddies trap larvae close to natal reefs. Local retention was found to increase as the resolution gets coarser, although the relationship is driven by one data point at 10 km, thus there is not enough information to infer a relationship.

![METRICS PANEL](../figs/metrics_panel.png){#fig:metrics_panel}

### Nesting hydrodynamic models

The self-recruitment at natal sites was significantly reduced (28.8% versus 0.9%) when using nested hydrodynamic models (i.e. sub-models with higher resolution to capture coastal dynamics; t = 7.15, df = 49.1, p\<0.05). However, caution should be used when evaluating this result due to the large unbalance samples between the groups (only 10 models describing self-recruitment had nested designs versus 50 which did not). There was no significant difference in the settlement success or dispersal distance when using nested models, and there were no studies using nested models where we were able to get local retention values. Again, the results are not as hypothesised, as increasing resolution to capture coastal dynamics theoretically increases self-recruitment and local retention, while lowering the dispersal distance.

### Open systems vs closed systems

There was no evidence that the geographic openness of the ocean system being modelled was consistently affecting the connectivity results derived from the models. While both self-recruitment and settlement success (38% and 22% higher respectively) were greater in a closed system, the difference was not significant (self-recruitment: t = 1.24, df = 16.5, p > 0.05; settlement success: t = 0.97, df = 64, p > 0.05). This result is also unexpected given the presumably elevated rates of larval loss in open systems, but it should be noted that the samples sizes here are small. Of course, this lack of difference could also be indicative of researchers appropriately choosing the boundaries of the modelled systems based on the biology of the modelled taxa. In this case, even seemingly open systems, may in fact be demographically closed ones. Dispersal distance was 3.4 times greater in open systems, compared to closed (t = -3.75, df = 41.8, p \< 0.05). This can be explained by the geographical nature of an open system, potentially allowing more larvae to be dispersed away from settlement sites and into large oceanic features. There were not enough data points on local retention for a meaningful comparison.

### Biological parameterisation

#### Pelagic larval duration

Local retention to the natal site showed a significant positive relationship with the length of PLD (r^2^ = 0.57, F(1,16) = 20.95, p \< 0.05), although this relationship is based on limited data (n=18). There was no relationship with either self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.02, F(1,54) = 1.12, p > 0.05) or settlement success (r^2^ = 0.05, F(1,59) = 3.08, p > 0.05). Dispersal distance also had no strong relationship with PLD (r^2^ = 0.02, F(1,43) = 1.10, p > 0.05). This is supported by studies that have shown there is no easily defined relationship between dispersal distance and PLD [@Mora:2012kn], although other studies have found a positive relationship [@Corell:2012id]; which is the intuitive result.

#### Settlement competency window

The settlement competency window, dependent on the pelagic larval duration, was strongly negatively correlated with local retention (r^2^ = 0.70, F(1,9) = 20.83, p \< 0.05) and weakly positively correlated with self-recruitment (r^2^ = 0.27, F(1,18) = 6.69, p \< 0.05). The was no significant relationship with settlement success (r^2^ = 0.09, F(1,24) = 2.39, p > 0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^ = 0.04, F(1,19) = 0.75, p > 0.05). One would assume a greater competency window size would enhance opportunities for successful settlement and to do so over a greater distance. Thus the lack of effect here is surprising, though it is possible any observable relationships are masked by the impact of parameterisation decisions made by these models which may have stronger effects on settlement success (e.g. mortality, see below). The strong tendency for models with longer window sizes to have lower self-recruitment is seemingly contradictory. However, as this increased window size will affect individuals at later stages of the larval period only, any larvae old enough to benefit from the extended window are potentially further from the natal site, and thus less expected to contribute to self-recruitment.

#### Mortality

Models which included mortality had similar levels of self-recruitment (t = -1.54, df = 58, p > 0.05) and settlement success (t = 0.35, df = 84, p > 0.05) to models run without mortality (@fig:mortality). Including mortality also had no effect on the dispersal distance of the marine larvae (t = -1.16, df = 9.1, p > 0.05). There was a significant difference in local retention when mortality was applied (t = -3.21, df = 4.3, p \< 0.05), however the degrees of freedom are low. Mortality did reduce the variation of the settlement success and the dispersal distance (apart from two outliers), which is an expected result. The variation of self-recruitment values increased, which would occur if settlement success also decreased, as less larvae would be arriving from other sites.

#### Movement behaviours

The inclusion of orientated swimming and combining orientated swimming with the ability to sense settlement sites produced significantly lower self-recruitment than if the larvae were given the ability to move (@fig:behaviours). The was no significant difference in self-recruitment if you included movement, settlement sensory or a combination of the two over passive behaviour. This was an unexpected result, as stated above, previous studies have shown behaviour to increase self-recruitment. While the non-significant result might be driven by outliers, movement and settlement both produce lower self-recruitment than passive larvae. The few data points for local retention showed no difference between passive or moving larvae. Previous work has shown that local retention was increased when vertical migration strategies were included in the model [@Robins:2013ih]. Settlement success was is highest, increasing by more than a factor of two, when both movement and settlement are included in the model, significantly different from passive larvae, moving larvae and settlement sensing larvae (@fig:behaviours). Orientation had high variation in settlement success and reduced this increase when combined with settlement sensing, but it was still significantly different from the settlement success of passive larvae. Individual studies have shown orientation to increase settlement success [@Staaterman:2012ek], the differences are assumed to be in the small number of models that implemented orientation. It was surprising there was mo difference between the settlement success of moving and passive particles, it has been shown movement to increase the settlement success [@Aiken:2011fx]. Dispersal distance was significantly reduced with the inclusion of orientated swimming and combining orientated swimming with the ability to sense settlement sites, than if the larvae were only given the ability to move (@fig:behaviours). The was no significant difference in dispersal if you included movement, settlement sensory or a combination of the two over passive behaviour. This was not an unexpected result, as previous studies have shown either behaviour to limit the dispersal of pelagic larvae [@Butler:2011wu] or for vertical movement to increase dispersal distance [@Corell:2012id], suggesting interactions with other parameters are involved.

Conclusion and recommendations
------------------------------

(Trend towards implementing behaviour)
The popularity of BDMs as a connectivity research tool has been on a downward trend since 2012. However, the implementation of these models are getting more complex, especially for ichthyoplankton, where 2016 marked the first time a majority of BDMs implemented larval movement behaviours. The proportion of studies using settlement sensory strategies was consistent across the review period for models of either fish or invertebrate species, not keeping up with the trend seen in implementing movement. Researchers appear to be heeding the recommendations of publications such as the ICES manual and other research showing the importance of movement in influencing connectivity patterns. Form a biological viewpoint this is encouraging, as it is in keeping with the research showing that biology matters in dispersal.

(Surprising amount of variability in the metrics data)
The large variation seen in both the model inputs and the connectivity metrics produced from these BDMs was unexpected. Variability of metrics is most likely driven due to the non-trivial number of parameter choices made, both physical and biological, in BDMs, many of which are optional or species specific. There is a grey area when determining what information to include in a model and what level of accuracy and precision is required for biological inputs.

(No obvious (or easy) patterns between parameter choice and metrics)
The current state of the field gives the impression it is not moving forward as coherently it should be in the eight years since the ICES manual of recommended practices was published [@North:2009tx]. A significant reason for this is the absence of published data on the early-life history of many marine species, highlighting a key area of required future research. Without data, it is difficult to justify introduce behaviour into models, as robust models aim to minimise assumptions. This review has also highlighted the lack of unity in both input parameters and metrics to describe the output of the BDMs. There appears to be no consensus on what biological parameters to choose when implementing a model, i.e. what behaviours are required in a BDM to accurately estimate the connectivity for a reef fish species. BDMs are non-trivial models, making it difficult to standardise the output in order to produce simple comparisons. Although agreement about common metrics and consistent metrics reporting would help alleviate some of these issues. Standardisation of metrics will also assist in validating the estimated patterns of connectivity with empirical studies (e.g. genetic studies, comparisons long-term known recruitment data and other techniques where appropriate), providing important model validation. Model validation should be an ultimate goal of BDM studies, especially as understanding connectivity is a central tenet of designing marine reserves [@Almany:2009io, @Bode:2016bq].

(More model validation required!)
In conclusion, we believe in order for this field to progress further, we need to better understand the relative importance of different behaviours of connectivity for ichthyoplankton and other marine families (potentially species/taxa specific). This understanding will us to generate baseline models for connectivity and highlight areas of knowledge gaps in early-life history that need to be addressed so we can confidently parametrise these BDMs and generate better outcomes.
