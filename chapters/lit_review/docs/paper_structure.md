SECTION: Introduction
* Background on biophysical models (how much to give?)
* Scope section to define the scope of what is and isn’t included in the review

SECTION: Methods (some people have, some people do not)
* Literature search 
* How were papers classified
* Data analysis

SECTION: Where are the state of models today?
* General
* Physical
* Biological
* Metrics used to measure output

SECTION: What parameters are important 
* Discuss the common metrics used for comparison
* Is the choice of physical parameter important?
* Is the choice of biological parameter important? 

SECTION: Conclusion (….and perspectives / recommendations)
* What did we find out?
* Where should models be going / are we on the right track?
* Caveats and limitations (e.g. common metrics)
