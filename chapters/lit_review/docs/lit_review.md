# Literature review





## Introduction 
The introduction should:

define your topic and provide an appropriate context for reviewing the literature;
establish your reasons – i.e. point of view – for
reviewing the literature;
explain the organisation – i.e. sequence – of the review;
state the scope of the review – i.e. what is included and what isn’t included. For example, if you were reviewing the literature on obesity in children you might say something like: There are a large number of studies of obesity trends in the general population. However, since the focus of this research is on obesity in children, these will not be reviewed in detail and will only be referred to as appropriate.

### First background paragraph 
This review focuses on biophysical connectivity models. 

####What is a biophysical model? 

####When did we start utilising them? 

- The ICES manual was released in 2009, have people been implementing models using this paper? It has a suite of recommendations. Want to evaluate if the field is moving forward at all, or are we just making the same mistakes. 


####What are they used for?

####Aims of the review

This review investigated studies of a variety of marine species, not just ichtyoplankton models, because often the differences in input parameterisation are negligible.


- Last review was in 2007 (Miller). 

The problem with connectivity modelling is that the output is rarely attempted to be verified. Without progression in the field, the distance between producing garbage or accurate results will not narrow. The end goal is to understand what input parameters are required to make the most accurate model possible (with appropriate trade-offs), to allow us to infer compelling conclusions. 

 - Talk about the advances in computing power and the increasing number of programming literate scientists. These studies are now not beyond the reach of many scientists as they were ten years ago

#####Study aims: 

1. Wanted to compare how larval behaviours affected the connectivity patterns of models. The aim was to understand what behaviours are required to produce the most accurately generated models.



## Methods

Our review used the keywords connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. In total we found 76 studies matching these criteria within this period, published in 34 different journals (the full list of references and the data extracted is provided as part of the Supplementary materials). We limited the search to publication dates post-2007, as oceanographic models are the biggest influence on connectivity patterns and the resolution of these models are constantly being refines, in both spatial scale and in resolving mesoscale processes such as eddies. Therefore this arbitrary date was chosen as a cut-off in order for us to compare studies hopefully using similarly resolved physical models. 
This higher resolution makes it hard to compare between models.

Papers were assessed in three main sections, the input parameters of their physical model, the input parameters of the biological model and the metrics used to measure the model output. The physical model section included details such as the oceanographic model used, the particle tracking software, diffusion methods and model time-step. The biological model section recorded the species modelled, pelagic larval durations and the larval behaviours implemented, e.g. mortality, vertical migration or growth. The last section focused on how the study measured the output of the model. These varied widely, with X different metrics used to describe the patterns of connectivity. These metrics ranged from more common metrics such as dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices to unique metrics described by the study. Most studies performed multiple runs of their model, using different input parameters. We identified these criteria for each model specified in the study, not just that was used overall in the paper. For instance some studies might have 75 different model runs described in their paper, while others will have the one model run. 

Models were classified into four categories basic on the objective of the study: climate change, marine park connectivity, dispersal & settlement and theoretical. Climate change objectives sought to see how larval connectivity patterns changed over by temporal and spatial scales by increasing ocean temperatures. Marine park connectivity studies were focused on seeing how well connected either existing or potential marine parks were connected for various species. Dispersal and settlement approaches were interested in the dispersal or settlement of a particular species using known input parameters. Theoretical approaches to connectivity studies investigated how different larval parameters effected the pattens of connectivity. 


## Main Body

### Study species / Study areas

Most of the studies are concentrated in Northern Hemisphere, especially in the seas around Europe, with the North-West Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea accounting for 36% of the studies we investigated (Figure 4). These are 



## Where are we now?

###Physical model inputs

Comparisons with ichthyology & connectivity modelling in general? 

### Biological model inputs


### #What are the behaviours that are getting modelled



## Metrics

###How do the behaviours influence metrics?


## Future directions



## Conclusion
The conclusion should:

summarise the important aspects of the existing body of literature;
evaluate the current state of the literature reviewed;
identify significant flaws or gaps in existing knowledge;
outline areas for future study;
link your research to existing knowledge.
