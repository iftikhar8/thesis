# Literature review


Our review used the keywords connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS.In total we found 59 studies matching these criteria within this period, consisting of 248 contributing authors and published in 31 different journals (the full list of references is provided in the Supplementary materials). 


## Introduction 
The introduction should:

define your topic and provide an appropriate context for reviewing the literature;
establish your reasons – i.e. point of view – for
reviewing the literature;
explain the organisation – i.e. sequence – of the review;
state the scope of the review – i.e. what is included and what isn’t included. For example, if you were reviewing the literature on obesity in children you might say something like: There are a large number of studies of obesity trends in the general population. However, since the focus of this research is on obesity in children, these will not be reviewed in detail and will only be referred to as appropriate.

## Main Body


## Where are we now?

Comparisons with ithychology & connectivity modelling in general? 

### What are the behaviours that are getting modelled



## How do the behaviours influence metrics?


## Future directions



## Conclusion
The conclusion should:

summarise the important aspects of the existing body of literature;
evaluate the current state of the literature reviewed;
identify significant flaws or gaps in existing knowledge;
outline areas for future study;
link your research to existing knowledge.
