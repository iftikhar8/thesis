# Title
Review of biophysical modelling in investigating connectivity patterns in marine species with a pelagic larval stage.

# Introduction
Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) has been used to investigate marine dispersal patterns for close to 30 years [@Bartsch:1988vg], and has become increasingly employed in the last 15 years to hypothesise patterns of connectivity. BDMs produce potential patterns of connectivity using a physical (i.e. oceanographic) model coupled with a model of the marine species of interest, using the knowledge about their biology <<CITE>>. These BDMs lend themselves to studies inferring distributional patterns (e.g. connectivity) of marine larval dispersal for species with two distinct life stages, a pelagic larval and contrasting sedentary adult phases [@Cowen:2009fm]. BDMs are powerful research tools, allowing us to investigate potential connectivity patterns over wide spatial scales [@Andrello:2013cc; @Treml:2015bt] and long temporal scales [@Richar:2014cg; @Berglund:2012cr], scales that are experimentally difficult to capture using current empirical methods [@Cowen:2009fm]. These models also provide us the ability to investigate how different early-life history traits (e.g. mortality, swimming ability, and orientation) affect the patterns of connectivity  [@Butler:2011wu; @Staaterman:2012ek], questions that would typically be intractable *in situ* due to the inherent difficulties of studying the larval phase of marine species <<CITE>>.

Complexity and realism in the BDMs used by studies has progressively increased; driven in part by advancements in parallel programming coupled with greater access to high performance computing, and open access high resolution oceanographic flow models <<CITE>>. Empirical research studies are also behind these increases, they are increasingly demonstrating the ability of pelagic larvae to affect their own fate via a variety of behaviours [@Leis2010325]. This trend was clear in Millerâ€™s (2007) review of ichthyoplankton biophysical modelling (referred to by Miller as individual-level, coupled physical-biological models), where 43.3% of studies implemented behaviour, and in the main, age-dependent vertical migration behaviour. This increased focus on the importance of the biology of these dispersal models has led to important insights of the importance of larval behaviour on dispersal.  Vertical movement of larval fish has been shown to dampen the dispersal kernel, increasing retention near the natal site, and affect connectivity patterns [@Paris:2004te][@Brochier:2008hd][@Robins:2013ih][@Paris:2007hm]. Horizontal swimming has not been included as much as vertical migration, and it can likely only influence connectivity patterns if the swimming is orientated [@Leis:2007jh]. From empirical studies we know larval fish can achieve sizeable swimming speeds, potentially giving the ability to out-swim the surrounding current, and it improves substantially with growth [@Leis:2006kf]. Horizontal swimming with orientation increased settlement success, including settlement at or near the natal site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. Spawning behaviour (along with the location of the natal site) has been shown to significantly affect dispersal patterns [@Puckett:2014cx].

This previous work has made it clear that the biological components of transport models can strongly affect connectivity patterns. And this emphasis has been recognised in the ICES publication, "Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life", which recommends their inclusion and provides guidance for how to do this [@Anonymous:2009tx]. Larval behaviour has also been emphasised in published BDM tools, such as the Connectivity Modelling System [@Paris:2013fs] & Connie <<CITE>> . But despite this increasing attention paid to the inclusion of biology in BDM, there remains little consensus on the relative importance of different parameters. This is understandable given the potentially for these to be context dependent. For instance, the importance of horizontal swimming may depend upon the length of the larval period, or the ability of horizontal swimming to affect connectivity may depend on the local geography of the modelled environment and the strength of vertical flow gradients. BDMs typically feature a high number of parameters and there is often little published information with which to determine exact values. As a result, researchers must often make decisions about what behaviours to include and what values to give the behaviours. The objective of this study was to review existing BDM studies to evaluate progress in the field in the inclusion of biological parameters and provide insight into the relative importance of different parameters, as well as any context dependence of these.

Specifically, the first aim was to understand what biological parameters were being implementing in BDMs for estimating connectivity patterns, i.e. was there a consensus of the most important, and how these biological parameters influence the connectivity patterns as measured through common metrics. If we can ascertain the importance of biological parameters in influencing these patterns, it will allow us to prioritise collecting empirical data on these traits and behaviours, information required to seed the BDMs. An inherent challenge in connectivity modelling is the difficulty in verifying the output as proportional to the spatial and temporal scales used in the model <<CITE>>. Progression in the field requires that we have a degree of confidence in the accuracy and precision of our generated connectivity patterns, important for results that we are unable to empirically replicate. The second aim of the review was to use a meta-analysis to see how different behaviours impacted connectivity patterns. Understanding how changes in biological parameterisation affects metrics of dispersal and connectivity across studies allows us greater insight in the importance of each BDM parameter. It also allows us to focus our efforts on collecting the empirical data on these behaviours by identifying trends. The scope of this review did not include verifying the accuracy of individual models.

# Methods

## Literature search
We searched for studies to review using the keywords connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. We found 76 studies matching these criteria, published in 34 different journals (see the full list of references and the data extracted in the Supplementary materials). We constrained the search to publications from 2009, as this was the publication date of a manual recommending the way forward for biophysical connectivity models [@Anonymous:2009tx], and also close to the date the last review in this area [@Miller:2007iu]. Whilst our primary research interest is the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton, we included connectivity studies modelling other marine species with a pelagic larval stage (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and corals), owing to often negligible differences in parameterised behaviours.

## Data classification
Most studies performed connectivity simulations using variations of their BDM, involving different input values for one or more parameters. This was often undertaken to test the effect of different parameters (representing different species/taxa or variations in behaviours of the same species/taxa) on resulting connectivity patterns. In this review, we separately identify each of these scenarios within a study and refer to each as a model. Nearly all studies consisted of a small number of models, although one study contained 99 models.

We characterised each model run within a study according to a variety of traits, which are broadly grouped into four themes. The first theme was general information about the study, such as study motivation, location, model species, and whether the system tropical or temperate. To see if there was an effect of the modelled geographical area on settlement, the regions were broadly categorised into open (coastal, island) or closed (bay or inland sea). We classified the motivation of a study based on its broad aims: climate change, marine park connectivity, dispersal and settlement, and theoretical. Climate change objectives identified temporal and spatial changes in larval connectivity patterns with increases in ocean temperatures. Marine park connectivity studies determined the extent of connectedness of either existing or potential marine parks for different species. Dispersal and settlement approaches concerned either the dispersal or settlement of a species using known spawning or settlement sites. Theoretical approaches to connectivity studies investigated how different larval parameters effected the patterns of connectivity. The second theme focused on the inputs used to parametrise the physical model. Assessing the physical model included details such as the oceanographic model used, the particle tracking software, diffusion methods and the model time-step. The third theme considered the input parameters of the biological model, recording larval traits such as pelagic larval duration, settlement competency, spawning times and behaviours, e.g. mortality, vertical migration, and growth. The length of the settlement competency window determined as the time-period between the first age of settlement competency and the end of the pelagic larval duration. The fourth theme recorded the metrics used to measure the connectivity patterns of the model. The metrics used varied considerably, with in-excess of 25 different metrics used to describe the patterns of connectivity. These metrics ranged from common metrics such as dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices to unique to the study (defined in @tbl:definitions). These metrics can be broadly categorised into two related classes. The first is purely dispersal, which using the dispersal kernel and provided metrics of spread, distance and direction travelled. The second class described the settlement of larvae, using measures such as self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success (defined in @tbl:definitions).

## Data analysis
To address our aim of evaluating the usage of biological models in BDMs in recent years, we used input values found in the methods and supplementary materials of the reviewed studies. We obtained the metrics values from a combination of the text, tables or figures. We used the software package GraphClick (version 3.0.3; http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/) to derive values from figures. We conducted all data analysis using the R programming language version 3.3.2 [@RAlanguageanden:wf], specifically the package *tidyverse* to manipulate the data [@Wickham:2016te] and the package *ggplot2* to produce the figures [@Wickham:2009tn].

To address our aim of identifying the importance of different metrics on connectivity and the context dependence of this, we tested each parameter against the common metrics of mean- self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance if enough data points were available. There were difficulties in acquiring measures to compare amongst the studies due to the different metrics used for measuring dispersal and connectivity. When there were common approaches, such as connectivity matrices, visual tools such as heat maps often hid the underlying data points, impeding meta-analysis. We performed linear regressions and Student's t-tests (checking for equal variance using Bartlett's test) with the R base package. For each dispersal metric, we used means to describe the data in a single statistic, allowing for comparisons against the physical and biological model parameters.

# Current trends in biophysical connectivity modelling
Of the study motivations classified, the overwhelming motivation for using a connectivity biophysical model was to answer questions about dispersal and settlement (68.0%; @fig:motivation). Dispersal models without settlement (13.3%) and studies motivated by investigating marine park connectivity (12.0%) occurred in equal frequencies. Theoretical (4.0%) and climate change (2.67%) were motivations used infrequently. Understandably, climate change models are not that common, as predicting connectivity patterns in 50-100 years, using current hydrodynamic modelling has inherent predictive complications. A handful of studies used a purely theoretical approach to understanding the biology that influences connectivity, although within another applied context, e.g. using different species in a study that have varied behaviours or traits, studies indirectly accomplished this.

![The number of studies within each of the five major categories of  motivations identified in this review (DS = dispersal and settlement; DI = dispersal; MP = marine park connectivity; TH = theoretical; CC = climate change)](../figs/motivations.png)[@#fig:motivation]

The studies in this review used hydrodynamic models covering 20 oceanographic regions across the world, two studies even investigated connectivity patterns at a global scale (@fig:ocean_regions).  Similarly, patterns observed in Miller's (2007) [-@Miller:2007iu] review, the modelling effort concentrated on highly industrialised fishing regions, such as the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Most studies use temperate waters in their models (64.9%), also reflected in Miller's (2007) review. The notable difference between the reviews was the increase in the number of studies in tropical oceanic regions (32.4%, risen from 4%). The early-life histories of tropical marine species are commonly researched, and thus this increase focus on tropical connectivity patterns is not unexpected.

![The oceanic regions used in the reviewed studies](../figs/oceanic_region.png)[@#fig:ocean_regions]

Most studies used an existing biophysical connectivity model (82.6%), conversely 16% of studies built a BDM for their specific connectivity study. This high model reuse suggests both an increasing maturity in both the model results and in the ease of use. The three most popular biophysical models used amongst the reviewed studies were Ichthyop (18.7%) [@Lett:2008fo], Connectivity Modelling System (12.0%) [@Paris:2013fs], & MGET (8.0%) [@Roberts:2010df]. Overall, it was determined that 21 different biophysical models (ignoring version numbers) were used amongst the studies, although we were unable to identify the exact particle tracking model used for nearly one quarter of the studies (22.7%). Forecasting models were used, with one exception - a hindcast solution whereby the larvae are initially tracked from settlement sites to determine their natal sites [@Wren:2016gu]. Hindcast models provide the ability to test models against known settlement sites, therefore it was expected they would be used more in tandem with forecasting models.

## How connectivity studies are parameterising the physical models

**INTRODUCTION NEEDED**
**WILL: Given these are results/discussion sections, I think it would be smart to pose a topic sentence which clarifies the hypotheses about each section. So here you could say. Miller indicated blah blah about conversion of modelling environments to similar approaches. In our review of the this more r cent period we saw blah blahâ€¦some confomirty in modes used but still great variance inâ€¦.  or something like that. Then describe thei specifics.  So just a sentence that lets the reader know what we're looking for here so this isn't just a description but rather a comment on the state of the discipline.**


The choice of oceanographic model depended upon the study region. The two most common ocean circulation models used were the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS; 25.3%) and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; 17.3%). Nested circulation models were used in the more complex particle trackers to bypass issues of low resolution in modelling. The mean resolution used in these connectivity models was 5.6km^2^, with the finest resolution 50m^2^ [@Brennan:2014fm] to the coarsest resolution of 33km^2^ [@Crochelet:2013kr]. As seen in Miller's 2007 review, there was no trend over time towards high resolution models.

The time particles updated in the system (environmental forcing) were either fixed time-steps or varied per other factors. The median time-step was one hour, and ranged between 60 seconds [@Moritz:2013dc] and 24 hours [@Mora:2012kn]. The time-step used was not reported in 37.3% of the studies. The choice of time-step is determined by both the physical model and computational choices, and no rational was given for the decision in those studies. The models used different time-scales of oceanographic data depending on the trends of interest (inter- or intra-annual). Studies trended towards running the biophysical model using only the time-scale of a few years (median = 3 years), with the majority using only a single year  in their connectivity study. Only one study used the average of several years input data to interpret mean connectivity patterns [@Feutry:2013je]. Other outliers included studies investigating climate change scenarios, which used periods of 60 years [@Aiken:2011dv] and 130 years [@Andrello:2014ge]. In these studies, the earliest year modelled was 1950, and the latest year modelled was 2100 (using ocean current data based on past averages). The average of the dates modelled was a start date of 2001 with an end date of 2008. Although not all models used continuous years as input choosing rather to use only specific years. As high powered computing becomes more readily available and with the known variability between consecutive years in hydrodynamic modelling, the trend for biophysical models should hopefully be towards using longer periods of ocean data as input, though there is little evidence for this trend over the past 20 years based on Miller and this review. Its important to move in this direction as the use of more years also allows for inter-annual comparisons in connectivity patterns.

## How connectivity studies are parametrising the biological models

**INTRODUCTION NEEDED**

Ten specific and one generic marine taxonomic groups were identified in the studies we reviewed (@fig:taxa). The generic taxonomic group was used by studies that defined as a suite of biological parameters that could potentially apply to multiple species, e.g. many species of reef fish most likely have a pelagic larval duration of 20 days. Generic species were used in 40.2% of the models, although one study used 99 models (28.4% of the total analysed models in the review) implementing a suite of generic parameters [@Treml:2015bt]. The 10 known taxonomic groups were comprised from 47 species and another seven where the modelled biological group was specified at the family level, e.g. Labridae or Sparidae.  The two most common taxa modelled were fish (39%) and bivalves (10%). The number of BDM studies modelling fish that were published each year were consistent to what was seen in Miller (2007).

![The different taxonomic groups that were used to parameterise the biological models in the reviewed connectivity studies](../figs/species.png)[@#fig:taxa]

The biological parameters implemented were not consistent across studies. The only biological parameters that were implemented consistently across studies in this review, were the traits pelagic larval duration (100%) and spawning behaviour (98.3%; as mentioned previously there was a single hindcast study). It is not abundantly clear why there is no consistency in the traits and behaviours captured by the biological models. Possible reasons are that researchers do not agree that biology has much influence on connectivity patterns, that certain traits and behaviours are species specific, or that there is not enough empirical evidence to parametrise the model with confidence.

**WILL: How compare to miller? Prob say it's clear why these two are in as they are quite necessary and fundamental. Then say, the lack of others could be they are viewed as not important but given recent lit on importance of behave and general acknowledgment of importance of bio, this is unlikely. It's most likely that lack of knowledge about param values and difficulty to implement prevents. Though a perceived lack of importance for certainly n Params could be important hereâ€¦vert migration?**

### Pelagic larval duration
Information on the length of time an organism, known as the pelagic larval duration (PLD), will spend in the pelagic environment prior to settlement at a site is fundamental to any attempt at dispersal modelling (@tbl:behaviours). The studies we reviewed exhibited two different approaches when implementing the pelagic larval duration. The standard approach (92.4% of models) was to make the PLD value fixed for each larva. If the individual larva reaches this time, it either must settle (if possible) or it is considered dead. The other approach was to implement variability in the PLD (5.6% of models), either using a Gaussian distribution (based on knowledge of the population) or instead of using time, make the PLD dependent on ocean temperature. The fixed PLD values ranged from a brief 2 days to a prolonged 420 days, with a median of 30 days. The PLDs were taken from known ranges found in the literature where available, with the longest PLDs occurring for invertebrate species e.g. the long duration (~400 days) of the phyllosoma stage of lobster larvae [@ButlerIV:2011kq; @Kough:2013fa].

### Settlement competency window
PLDs were often used in conjunction with a settlement competency window (48.7%). The settlement competency window gives the marine larvae a period in which they can settle before they reach the end of their pelagic larval duration. It is based on their known biology, where possible, incorporating the idea that most species with a pelagic larval phase must develop sufficiently before the pelagic stage can finish. The range of start dates for this window were from day 0, meaning the larvae can settle from birth, up to 152 days. The median start date when the larvae were considered developed enough to settle was 9 days.

### Spawning strategies
A second fundamental element, included by necessity, in every study in our review was a spawning strategy, which determined how the larvae were released in the model. The spawning strategy was typically dependent on the biology of the modelled taxa and included pelagic eggs, demersal eggs, or brooding. To implement these different strategies, studies changed depth for the release of the larvae, e.g. demersal eggs were released on the bottom of the natal reef and pelagic eggs were released higher up the water column. The two strategies for releasing the particles at depth were either to use a fixed depth (37.5%), or to randomly release the larvae over a range of depth values (60.8%), i.e. release larvae in in the 0-20 m range of the water column. The timing of when larvae were released varied from hourly intervals [@Jacobi:2012cz], daily [@Kough:2013fa], monthly [@Staaterman:2012ek], on lunar cycles [@Davies:2014cw] or a one-off spawning event [@Herbert:2011bh]. The spawning windows relied on the known biology and what times of year the species is known to produce larvae. Typically the spawning events were pre-determined, but several studies used temperature as a spawning initiation [@Andrello:2014ge; @Rochette:2012io] or even wave height was used to release abalone larvae in one model [@Miyake:2011hr]. The release sites and settlement sites were the same for most studies. However, several studies (**X%**) used a limited set of key release sites with more available settlement sites. The larvae spawned at each site ranged from 10 larvae up to 10 million, with a median of 6,800. The total larvae tracked in the system (spawning site multiplied by the number of sites multiplied by the number of releases) had a similarly large range, from 328 to 610 million larvae, with a median total of 3.2 million. To simplify tracking these large numbers of larvae in the system, five studies (15.6%) used the concept of a super-individual, whereby a single larva in the system represents a larger number of larvae with a normalised collection of attributes. There are large computational benefits to this approach, especially in models that use a continuous space. The caveat is that you must consider how much individual variation you are willing to lose by modelling these super-individuals.

*WILLS COMMENT: Would it be possible to give the average number of larvae released from a site that were used to make one connectivity matrix?  This would differentiate situations where, for instance they released 100,000 larvae from each site, ran them out and made a matrix and they did this every weekâ€¦so one matrix per week.  As compared to another study which may have released 100000 ever week for a month and then used all this info to make one matrix.  The idea would be to give some sort of guidance on the amount of larvae people seem to think is enough to generate a single estimate of connectivity.*

*STEVES COMMENT: I would have to go back and check this out, mostly they provided one connectivity matrix or perhaps one per month or year. Will take me half a day to comb through all the studies again, but I can do it. I'll wait to see if there are other things I need to look for as well*

### Mortality and growth
Larval mortality was implemented in only 41% of the models (@tbl:behaviours). However, the implementation of mortality varied across the models, with the most common mortality function used was a linear function (82.2%), whereby a fixed percentage of the larvae were killed each day. The daily mortality rate in these studies varied from 1.7% to 30.0% with an average of 19.4%.  Other  mortality implementations were to kill the larvae based on a known temperature or salinity threshold (7.9%), using a decay function that decreased mortality based on age (7.9%) or using a Weibull function (2.1%). Unlike in Miller's 2007 review, where growth was implemented in one-third of the studies, only 6% of the models reviewed had the ability for larvae to grow (@tbl:behaviours). The rationale is that the models used in this review are solely investigating connectivity, where growth is not considered such an important factor affecting the strength of connectivity amongst sites, unless it is co-implemented with a sinking velocity dependent on mass.

### Behaviour
The degree to which larvae can behave, specifically sense, orient and swim directionally (vertically or horizontally) is a fundamental concern in broader field of larval biology which has potentially important ramifications for connectivity. As discussed previously, this has been recognised in the world of BDM, with general support for the inclusion of such behaviours in biophysical models. In this review we classified models according to which of the four major larval behaviours were implemented; no movement (passive movement), movement (e.g. horizontal or vertical swimming), orientation (ability to orientate towards a reef using cues) and settlement (settle at a site using a sensory buffer or sticky zones).

Larvae were given the ability to move in 26% of the models, conversely in 74% of the models the larvae were assumed to be passive and moved solely using the physical model. Miller (2007) observed that 43% of the fish studies in the reviewed papers implemented a facet of larval behaviour, thus the percentage of BDM studies implementing larval behaviour is decreasing. Of the behaviours classified as movement, diel vertical migration was the most commonly implemented behaviour (45.4%; @tbl:swimming). Ontogenetic vertical migration, the idea that marine species change their vertical position in the water column as a factor of their ontogeny, was used in 27.2% of the models. Horizontal swimming was implemented in 12.5% of the models, although it must be mentioned that random movement to mimic turbulence does capture an extent of undirected horizontal swimming. A smaller number implemented vertical swimming in the larvae (4.5%). Other movements included in models were prompted by environmental conditions such as tides (circatidal migration 5.7%,), salinity (halocline migration; 1.1%), or migrating with the pycnocline (6.8%). Another movement implementation, as mentioned above, was using sinking velocity (3.4%) in conjunction with growth, e.g. the heavier the larvae the faster it sinks. The last strategy involved giving the pelagic eggs a buoyancy (4.5%) based on the salinity level in the water column, thus they can float at different vertical migrations.

| Swimming behaviour            | Implemented (%) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Horizontal swimming           | 12.5            |
| Vertical swimming             | 4.5             |
| Ontogenetic vertical swimming | 27.2            |
| Diel vertical migration       | 45.4            |
| Halocline migration           | 1.1             |
| Circatidal migration          | 5.7             |
| Pycnocline migration          | 6.8             |
| Sinking velocity              | 3.4             |
| Egg buoyancy                  | 4.5             |

The ability of the marine larvae to sense settlement habitat was implemented in 50.9% of the models. Of these, 95.4% opted for a buffer zone implementation, where each settlement site has a buffer added to it, increasing its size. The mean size of the buffer zone was 8.18 km (SD = 5.2 km). The other implementation, which essentially works on similar principles, was to give the larvae a detection distance relative to the centre of the settlement site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. This settlement cue was used to allow the larvae to orientate towards the reef if the larvae was within the cue distance ranging between 1-10 km (median distance was 5 km), with a combination of early and late onset orientating abilities.

For the studies modelling fish, the implementation of only passive movement decreased over the reviewed period. In 2015, for the first time there were more studies using movement behaviours than other forms of behaviour (@fig:fish_prop). Implementation of settlement sensory strategies remain constant over the published time period. Interestingly, the ability of fish to orientate towards settlement sites was only found to be implemented in one study in 2012. For invertebrates, there is no real change over time in the pattern of implemented behaviours (@fig:invert_prop).

This finding is extremely interesting from a biological viewpoint. There is empirical knowledge of fish behaviour influencing the outcome of connectivity [@Leis:2006kf; @Cowen:2009fm], BDM studies demonstrating that connectivity changes with behaviour, and studies suggesting the way forward is to include behaviour [@Staaterman:2014ee; @Anonymous:2009tx]. However, there are still many studies including models with no implemented behaviour at all - passive larvae were used in 75% of model configurations.

There is also a well established body of empirical literature which highlights the often extensive swimming abilities of ichthyoplankton [@Leis:2006kf; @Leis:2010jz]. Even where horizontal swimming is not important, many larvae have diel vertical migration patterns to below the mixed layer to escape predators during the day **CITE larvae diel migration**. Several studies in the review showed that vertical migration (either diel or ontogenetic) increased self-recruitment and limit the dispersal kernel [@Young:2012gb; @Aiken:2011dv]. Orientation was only implemented in one study, yet there is an increasing body of research in the last decade regarding the ability of reef fish larvae to orientate towards natal reefs using olfactory mechanisms [@Gerlach:2007gw], celestial cues [@Leis:2014es; @Faillettaz:2015dn] and a magnetic compass [@Bottesch:2016hl].

One possible reason for not implementing behaviour is that the complete (or even partial) early life history is often unknown for many species and researchers are trying to avoid using any behavioural assumptions in their models. Fish larval behaviour is known to be species specific, yet many models are limited to using known data from the family taxonomic level due to the lack of knowledge on a particular species. It was been argued that this approach is fraught with danger, as behaviour can vary widely amongst species within a family taxonomic grouping [@Leis2010325]. The lack of species specific knowledge poses the question, can we only model species where we fully understand the early life history, or is there a degree of assumption that is deemed to still be scientifically valid to answer the study question.

## The metrics used to describe connectivity
There was a lot of variation in the metrics used to describe the results of the connectivity studies. There were more than 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of dispersal and settlement. The common approaches were to use combinations of dispersal kernels (64.0%) and connectivity matrices (57.2%; @tbl:common_metrics). Less common measures of model output were larval centre of mass (average geographical position of the larvae; 2.6%) [@Lacroix:2013cf; @Miyake:2011hr], isotropy (describes the inertia around the centre of mass; 1.3%) [@Ayata:2010hg], positive area (number of areas that had larvae in them, 1.3%) [@Puckett:2014cx], and proportion of sites settled (1.3%) [@Robins:2013ih].

|                     | Local retention         | 62.0         |
|                     | Settlement success      | 42.0         |
| Graph theory        |                         | **8.1**      |


The trend in biophysical modelling is to present data using visual techniques such as heat maps, which while being effective tools for visually communicating complex patterns qualitatively, make it difficult to pull out quantified data points. The most common connectivity values reported in the the reviewed studiesâ€“when a connectivity matrix was presentedâ€“were self-recruitment (39.9%), local retention (35.3%) and global settlement success of larvae (23.9%; @tbl:common_metrics). However, while these response metrics were explicitly described, we were only able to extract actual values from 70.0%, 62.0%, and 42.0% of the studies in which connectivity matrices were described for self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success respectively.

Based on the extracted data, there was a large spread of the mean self-recruitment amongst the models, ranging from 0-98%, depending on the study, with a median self-recruitment value of 13.0%. Local retention, while mentioned for 31.7% of studies, we were only able to get mean local retention values for 5.5% of the models. Mean local retention ranged from 0.3-46.0%, with a median value of 6.0%. Overall mean settlement success of the larvae was extracted for 18.0% of the studies, ranging from 0.1-80% successful settlement rates, with a median of 26.8%.

### Discussion - integrate

The large range in these three metrics, especially settlement success, causes some concern about the maturity of these models. It was expected that the settlement success would be extremely low, even if mortality is not included in the system. The complicated suite of input parameters makes it difficult to tease out why the range is so large, whether it be the shape and size of the study site, high versus low resolution ocean models, area of settlement sites, larval mortality rate or length of PLDs.

Most people only reported potential connectivity models (potential is the probability of settlement, where realised is a more accurate measure offset by biological processes such as egg production and mortality).

**Probably wouldnâ€™t say that** Just want to make two points here:
-	Settlement success being so high seems odd.  Here you can make the point about how many used relaised versus potential connectivity.
-	There is large range

**Both of these are partly due to the large number of other factors used.  Below we explore how some of the modeling decisions ultimately affect param values.**

# Influence of modelling decisions on connectivity values

As indicated above, much of the variation observed in connectivity values and patterns across the reviewed study will be driven by modelling environments and especially parameterisation decision. Below we attempt to use the body of reviewed literature to assess the impact of various model and parameter choices on resulting connectivity values. As indicated in the methods section above, we have restricted consideration to only those model characteristics/input parameters and output connectivity metrics that were shared amongst the majority of studies.  Specifically we look at the impact two modelling environment characteristics (system choice) and four biological parameterisation decisions (larval duration, competency window, larval mortality and movement behaviour) on four key metrics of connectivity (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success & dispersal distance). Note there are situations where there were not enough data points to make valid comparison of specific connectivity metrics.

## Modelling environment

### Model choice
The choice of model

### Model resolution
There was a significant positive predictive relationship between model resolution and local retention (r^2^=0.82, p\<0.05), but no  relationship between model resolution and self-recruitment (r^2^=0.05, p\>0.05), settlement success (r^2^=0.01, p\>0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^=0.01, p\>0.05). This was unexpected given that sub-mesoscale processes are expected to be more accurately captured in the hydrodynamic model as the resolution increases, as would the connectivity patterns of the modelled larvae, e.g. increasing self-recruitment as small eddies trap larvae close to natal reefs. <<Insert Discussion Here>>

#### Nested model design
The self-recruitment at natal sites was significantly reduced (28.8% versus 0.9%) when nested models (i.e. submodels with higher resolution near settlement sites) were used (t=7.15, df=49.13 p\<0.05), however, caution should be used when evaluating this result due to the large unbalance between the groups (only 10 models describing self-recruitment had nested designs versus 50 which did not). There was no significant difference in the settlement success or dispersal distance when using nested models, and there were no studies using nested models where we were able to get local retention values. <<Insert Discussion Here>>

Other ideas for comparison which I need to quickly explore
  1. Choice of physical model? (correlated with location obviously)
  2. Choice of particle model? Do some models settle more than others?
  3. Years model was run? Was there a difference in multiple run years

### Open systems vs closed systems
There was no evidence that the geographic openness of the modelled system was consistently affecting the connectivity results derived from the models. While both self-recruitment and settlement success (38% and 22% higher respectively) were greater in closed system, the difference was not significant (self-recruitment: t=1.24, df=16.49, p\>0.05; settlement success: t = 0.97, df = 64, p\>0.05).  This result is unexpected given the presumably elevated rates of larval loss in open systems, but it should be noted that the samples sizes here are small. Of course, this lack of difference could also be indicative of researchers appropriately choosing the boundaries of the modelled systems based on the biology of the modelled taxa. In this case, even seemingly open systems, may in fact be demographically more similar to geographically (and thus also demographically) closed ones. Dispersal distance was 3.4 times longer in open systems, compared to closed (t=-3.75, df=41.82, p\<=0.05). This can be explained by the geographical nature of an open system, potentially allowing more larvae to be dispersed away from settlement sites and into large oceanic features. There were not enough data points on local retention for a meaningful comparison.

## Biological parameterisation


### Pelagic larval duration
Local retention was positively correlated with the the length of the pelagic larval periods (r=0.75, df=16, p\<0.05) when pelagic larval durations greater than 150 days were removed.
**When it wasn't explain this**
The pelagic larval duration was not significantly correlated with the other the three metrics. Again it must be noted local retention had the lowest sample size compared to the other metrics. Interestingly pelagic larval duration was not correlated with dispersal distance. Logically, longer dispersal times would theoretically lead to longer dispersal distances. This result has been seen in other studies (CITES).
**Add in more discussion to this section**

### Settlement competency window
The settlement competency window was negatively correlated with local retention (r^2^=0.70, p\<0.05) and a positively correlated with self-recruitment (r^2^=0.27, p\<0.05). The was no significant relationship with settlement success or dispersal distance. (Need to think about why LR would go down and SR would go up. LR goes down because longer window so means can settle further away, but why would SR go up - seems counter intuitive)

**Well, would expect SS to go up with CW, and it doesnâ€™t. Would expect inc in SS with CW would possibly dilute natal site larvae so SR would go down. Would expect inc in LR with inc CW. You sure we got our definitions correct here!?  This seems backwards.**

### Mortality included (need to compare size of linear mortality as well?)

**Have enough data?  Would be interesting to regress metrics on mortality rate**

Models which included mortality had higher levels of self-recruitment than those that didnâ€™t (@fig:sr_mort), statsâ€¦assuming this was significant?). The inclusion of mortality didnâ€™t have a strong effect on the mean overall settlement success, however there was much lower variability when mortality was included (statsâ€¦do a comparison of variation?) (@fig:ss_mort). Including mortality also seemed to increase the mean distance travelled of the larvae, which is the opposite of what is expected (@fig:dist_mort).

**Are there stats here?Need much better discussion of all thisâ€¦there is none. Note very high SS values. Including mortality knocks those  outâ€¦makes sense. But values are still high even with mort. Higher SR could be driven by lower SS in general but with non-natal larvae more affected than natal ones because they have to travel farther (so SR goes up). What about LR.**

![Comparison of the mean distance travelled with mortality included implemented in the model](../figs/dist_mortality.png)[@#fig:dist_mort]

### Movement behaviours
Models which included movement or settlement sensory abilities had overall lower mean self-recruitment levels than those which did not (@fig:behaviours_sr, **INCLUDE STATS**). This is an unexpected result, considering the overriding consensus is that self-recruitment is increased through behavioural implementations in the model [@Paris:2004te; @Werner:1993if].

**Is that what they sayâ€¦self recruitment?  I think they would mean local retention as we define it hereâ€¦prop from a site that come back.  Remember that self-recruitment levels will be tied up with overall SS as that directly related to the denom of the SR equation.  So if behavior drives up SS, which it seems to, then the denom goes up at all sites. And since the pool of larvae supplying the denom is potentially all sites while the numerator is only the natal site, even if SS goes up and equal prop for larvae from all sites, the denom will grow more than the num and the value of SR would go down.  So I think this result may actually be consistent.  Check my math. Also double check the prediction in those papers and if they didnâ€™t mean LR.**

While the maximum values for mean self-recruitment are higher with behaviour, other model parameters specific to the studies could be influencing this trend. If both these behaviours were included, then self-recruitment increased, although there are fewer data points for comparison. The large spread of values for self-recruitment, ranging from close to 100% down to almost none, also suggest that the is a mix of parameters influencing the self-recruitment seen in models.

The opposite trend appears to occur for settlement success (@fig:behaviours_ss). The highest settlement success occurred when multiple behaviours of movement & settlement or movement & orientation & settlement were all included in the model. Unfortunately there were not many studies that included orientation to draw meaningful comparisons about the influence of orientation on connectivity patterns, but the strong assumption is that it would also increase settlement success, as shown in individual studies [@Staaterman:2012ek].

Giving the larvae the ability to orientate early improved their chances of settling, and also increased self-recruitment.

# Conclusion and recommendations
This study has shown there was the large spread of values reported for these studies. The common measures of self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success all reported huge variations amongst studies. Seemingly obvious explanations such as open/closed systems did not explain the variance. These are inherently complex systems and teasing out the differences between studies is not a trivial task. The other key driver is the variability of the oceanographic currents, which change within and between years. Therefore, it was interesting there were still many studies that only looked at dispersal patterns over one or two year periods, arguably not allowing the model to capture enough natural variation.

**WILLS COMMENT: You canâ€™t just throw this in as a sentence.  What did you do, what does this mean?  Need to show that you actually looked at this in some objective manner so your argument that it can be dismissed will be accepted.You canâ€™t just throw this in as a sentence.

The first caveat to such an approach is that comparisons such are difficult because of the number of parameters used to configure these biophysical models that could all have an influence on the results. This is a complicated issue to resolve. Comparing many studies should cancel out some of the noise surrounding all the parameters. A future direction would be to determine a way to normalise the data based on the input parameters, allowing for more effective comparisons. Otherwise perhaps it is only prudent to compare studies that occur in the same oceanic region, at the same time, using the same physical models and perhaps the same particle disperser for consistency.

A consistent approach, including providing underlying data would assist in progressing the field for future comparisons, allowing us to understand why there is so much variation amongst reported measures such as self-recruitment and transport success.

The current state of the field feels like is not moving forward as coherently it should be. Studies have been calling for behaviour to be implemented for nearly a decade, yet most studies are still not including larval behavioural traits. This is despite the evidence that behaviours do change the described connectivity patterns. Perhaps we cannot move forward until these models, which include behaviour, are empirically validated. However, we would argue that the priority should be to start including both movement and settlement sensory abilities for species where this is applicable and known in the literature. The second priority to is provide clarity in metrics so we can meaningfully compare the outcomes of connectivity studies and progress the field further.

**This is all rather unfocused.  You want to get across here:**

This review shows:
  -	Fewer BPTM studies over the last few years but a greater proportion of them, especially those focused on fish taxa, seem to be taking the advice of XXX to include considerations about animal movement as opposed to being passive.
  -	There is quite a range of values for key metrics of connectivity coming out of these studies and this very likely necessarily due to modelling and parameter choices made.  For this dataset we can see that
  - Geography of system no strongly affecting things (good choices by researchers)?
  - Model resolution in general doesnâ€™tâ€™ have a strong effect though nested models do seem to deliver elevated SS ratesâ€¦discuss this as a key model choice.

**Keep going with this approach for the bio variables.  Highlight things that would be key model choices based on what we say.  So mortality and behavior both came out as important.  Also highlight things that donâ€™t seem to be as critical as we thought they mightâ€¦competency window for instance.  And may also note the lack of orientation behavior in models despite empirical evidence for its importance.**
