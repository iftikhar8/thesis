# Title
Review of biophysical modelling in investigating connectivity patterns in marine species with a pelagic larval stage.

# Introduction
Biophysical dispersal modelling (BDM) has been used to investigate marine dispersal patterns for close to 30 years [@Bartsch:1988vg], and has become increasingly employed in the last 15 years to hypothesise patterns of connectivity. BDMs produce potential patterns of connectivity using a physical (i.e. oceanographic) model coupled with a model of the marine species of interest, using the knowledge about their biology [CITE]. These BDMs lend themselves to studies inferring distributional patterns (e.g. connectivity) of marine larval dispersal for species with two distinct life stages, a pelagic larval and contrasting sedentary adult phases [@Cowen:2009fm]. BDMs are powerful research tools, allowing us to investigate potential connectivity patterns over wide spatial scales [@Andrello:2013cc; @Treml:2015bt] and long temporal scales [@Richar:2014cg; @Berglund:2012cr], scales that are experimentally difficult to capture using current empirical methods [@Cowen:2009fm]. These models also provide us the ability to investigate how different early-life history traits (e.g. mortality, swimming ability, and orientation) affect the patterns of connectivity  [@Butler:2011wu; @Staaterman:2012ek], questions that would typically be intractable *in situ* due to the inherent difficulties of studying the larval phase of marine species [CITE].

Complexity and realism in the BDMs used by studies has progressively increased; driven in part by advancements in parallel programming coupled with greater access to high performance computing, and open access high resolution oceanographic flow models [CITE]. Empirical research studies are also behind these increases, they are increasingly demonstrating the ability of pelagic larvae to affect their own fate via a variety of behaviours [@Leis2010325]. This trend was clear in Millerâ€™s (2007) review of ichthyoplankton biophysical modelling (referred to by Miller as individual-level, coupled physical-biological models), where 43.3% of studies implemented behaviour, and in the main, age-dependent vertical migration behaviour. This increased focus on the importance of the biology of these dispersal models has led to important insights of the importance of larval behaviour on dispersal.  Vertical movement of larval fish has been shown to dampen the dispersal kernel, increasing retention near the natal site, and affect connectivity patterns [@Paris:2004te;@Brochier:2008hd;@Robins:2013ih;@Paris:2007hm]. Horizontal swimming has not been included as much as vertical migration, and it can likely only influence connectivity patterns if the swimming is orientated [@Leis:2007jh]. From empirical studies we know larval fish can achieve sizeable swimming speeds, potentially giving the ability to out-swim the surrounding current, and it improves substantially with growth [@Leis:2006kf]. Horizontal swimming with orientation increased settlement success, including settlement at or near the natal site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. Spawning behaviour (along with the location of the natal site) has been shown to significantly affect dispersal patterns [@Puckett:2014cx].

This previous work has made it clear that the biological components of transport models can strongly affect connectivity patterns. And this emphasis has been recognised in the ICES publication, "Manual of recommended practices for modelling physical-biological interactions during fish early life", which recommends their inclusion and provides guidance for how to do this [@North:2009tx]. Larval behaviour has also been emphasised in published BDM tools, such as the Connectivity Modelling System [@Paris:2013fs] & Connie [CITE]. But despite this increasing attention paid to the inclusion of biology in BDM, there remains little consensus on the relative importance of different parameters. This is understandable given the potentially for these to be context dependent. For instance, the importance of horizontal swimming may depend upon the length of the larval period, or the ability of horizontal swimming to affect connectivity may depend on the local geography of the modelled environment and the strength of vertical flow gradients. BDMs typically feature a high number of parameters and there is often little published information with which to determine exact values. As a result, researchers must often make decisions about what behaviours to include and what values to give the behaviours. The objective of this study was to review existing BDM studies to evaluate progress in the field in the inclusion of biological parameters and provide insight into the relative importance of different parameters, as well as any context dependence of these.

Specifically, the first aim was to understand what biological parameters were being implementing in BDMs for estimating connectivity patterns, i.e. was there a consensus of the most important, and how these biological parameters influence the connectivity patterns as measured through common metrics. If we can ascertain the importance of biological parameters in influencing these patterns, it will allow us to prioritise collecting empirical data on these traits and behaviours, information required to seed the BDMs. An inherent challenge in connectivity modelling is the difficulty in verifying the output as proportional to the spatial and temporal scales used in the model [CITE]. Progression in the field requires that we have a degree of confidence in the accuracy and precision of our generated connectivity patterns, important for results that we are unable to empirically replicate. The second aim of the review was to use a meta-analysis to see how different behaviours impacted connectivity patterns. Understanding how changes in biological parameterisation affects metrics of dispersal and connectivity across studies allows us greater insight in the importance of each BDM parameter. It also allows us to focus our efforts on collecting the empirical data on these behaviours by identifying trends. The scope of this review did not include verifying the accuracy of individual models.

# Methods

## Literature search
We searched for studies to review using the keywords connectivity, model* and marine, querying the online search engines ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS. We found 76 studies matching these criteria, published in 34 different journals (see the full list of references and the data extracted in the Supplementary materials). We constrained the search to publications from 2009, as this was the publication date of a manual recommending the way forward for biophysical connectivity models [@North:2009tx], and also close to the date the last review in this area [@Miller:2007iu]. Whilst our primary research interest is the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton, we included connectivity studies modelling other marine species with a pelagic larval stage (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and corals), owing to often negligible differences in parameterised behaviours.

## Data classification
Most studies performed connectivity simulations using variations of their BDM, involving different input values for one or more parameters. This was often undertaken to test the effect of different parameters (representing different species/taxa or variations in behaviours of the same species/taxa) on resulting connectivity patterns. In this review, we separately identify each of these scenarios within a study and refer to each as a model. Nearly all studies consisted of a small number of models, although one study contained 99 models.

We characterised each model run within a study according to a variety of traits, which are broadly grouped into four themes. The first theme was general information about the study, such as study motivation, location, model species, and whether the system tropical or temperate. To see if there was an effect of the modelled geographical area on settlement, the regions were broadly categorised into open (coastal, island) or closed (bay or inland sea). We classified the motivation of a study based on its broad aims: climate change, marine park connectivity, dispersal and settlement, and theoretical. Climate change objectives identified temporal and spatial changes in larval connectivity patterns with increases in ocean temperatures. Marine park connectivity studies determined the extent of connectedness of either existing or potential marine parks for different species. Dispersal and settlement approaches concerned either the dispersal or settlement of a species using known spawning or settlement sites. Theoretical approaches to connectivity studies investigated how different larval parameters effected the patterns of connectivity. The second theme focused on the inputs used to parametrise the physical model. Assessing the physical model included details such as the oceanographic model used, the particle tracking software, diffusion methods and the model time-step. The third theme considered the input parameters of the biological model, recording larval traits such as pelagic larval duration, settlement competency, spawning times and behaviours, e.g. mortality, vertical migration, and growth. The length of the settlement competency window determined as the time-period between the first age of settlement competency and the end of the pelagic larval duration. The fourth theme recorded the metrics used to measure the connectivity patterns of the model. The metrics used varied considerably, with in-excess of 25 different metrics used to describe the patterns of connectivity. These metrics ranged from common metrics such as dispersal kernels and connectivity matrices to unique to the study (defined in @tbl:definitions). These metrics can be broadly categorised into two related classes. The first is purely dispersal, which using the dispersal kernel and provided metrics of spread, distance and direction travelled. The second class described the settlement of larvae, using measures such as self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success (defined in @tbl:definitions).

## Data analysis
To address our aim of evaluating the usage of biological models in BDMs in recent years, we used input values found in the methods and supplementary materials of the reviewed studies. We obtained the metrics values from a combination of the text, tables or figures. We used the software package GraphClick (version 3.0.3; http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/) to derive values from figures. We conducted all data analysis using the R programming language version 3.3.2 [@RAlanguageanden:wf], specifically the package *tidyverse* to manipulate the data [@Wickham:2016te] and the package *ggplot2* to produce the figures [@Wickham:2009tn].

To address our aim of identifying the importance of different metrics on connectivity and the context dependence of this, we tested each parameter against the common metrics of mean- self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance if enough data points were available. There were difficulties in acquiring measures to compare amongst the studies due to the different metrics used for measuring dispersal and connectivity. When there were common approaches, such as connectivity matrices, visual tools such as heat maps often hid the underlying data points, impeding meta-analysis. We performed linear regressions and Student's t-tests (checking for equal variance using Bartlett's test) with the R base package. For each dispersal metric, we used means to describe the data in a single statistic, allowing for comparisons against the physical and biological model parameters.

# Current trends in biophysical connectivity modelling
For the period we reviewed, the most studies occurred between 2011-2014, peaking at 20 studies in 2012 (@fig:years). The average number of BDM studies published per year was 15.3 in our review. In the last 8 years of Miller's (2007) review an average of 6.6 studies were published, demonstrating BDM studies have become more prevalent as a research tool. In this section we explore the current trends in both input parameters and output metrics of connectivity studies, using out four themes of general information, physical model parameters, biological model parameters, and the metrics of connectivity used.

![The number of published studies per year included in the review](../figs/years.png){#fig:years}

## General information about the studies
Ten specific and one generic marine taxonomic groups were identified in the studies we reviewed (@fig:taxa). The generic taxonomic group was used by studies that defined as a suite of biological parameters that could potentially apply to multiple species, e.g. many species of reef fish most likely have a pelagic larval duration of 20 days. Generic species were used in 40.2% of the models, although one study used 99 models (28.4% of the total analysed models in the review) implementing a suite of generic parameters [@Treml:2015bt]. The 10 known taxonomic groups were comprised from 47 species and another seven where the modelled biological group was specified at the family level, e.g. Labridae or Sparidae.  The two most common taxa modelled were fish (39%) and bivalves (10%). The number of ichthyoplankton BDMs that were published each year were consistent to what was reported in Miller (2007).

![The different taxonomic groups that were used to parameterise the biological models in the reviewed connectivity studies](../figs/taxa.png){#fig:taxa}

Most of the connectivity studies used an existing BDM (82.6%), the rest either build a BDM to answer the study question (16.0%) or information about the BDM was missing from the methods (1.4%). This high model reuse suggests an increasing maturity in the model output and the ease of adoption for end-users. The three most popular BDMs used amongst the reviewed studies were Ichthyop (18.7%) [@Lett:2008fo], Connectivity Modelling System (12.0%) [@Paris:2013fs], & MGET (8.0%) [@Roberts:2010df]. Twenty-one different BDMs (ignoring version numbers) were used amongst the studies, although we were unable to identify the exact particle tracking model used for 22.7% of the studies. The studies all used forecasting for their models, except for one hindcast solution (whereby the larvae are initially tracked from settlement sites to determine their natal sites) [@Wren:2016gu]. The reason for this perceived bias towards forecasting models is unknown.

The overwhelming motivation for using a BDM was to answer questions about dispersal and settlement (68.0%). Dispersal models without settlement (13.3%) and studies motivated by investigating marine park connectivity (12.0%) occurred in equal frequencies. Theoretical based studies (4.0%) and studies investigating how climate change effects connectivity (2.67%) were more sporadic motivations. A handful of studies used a purely theoretical approach to understanding the biology that influences connectivity, although within another applied context, e.g. using different species in a study that have varied behaviours or traits, studies indirectly accomplished this.

The studies in this review used hydrodynamic models covering 20 oceanographic regions across the world, two studies even investigated connectivity patterns at a global scale (@fig:ocean_regions). Similarly, patterns observed in Miller's (2007) [-@Miller:2007iu] review, modelling effort concentrated on highly industrialised fishing regions, such as the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Most studies use temperate waters in their models (64.9%), also reflected in Miller's (2007) review. The notable difference between the reviews was the increase in the number of studies in tropical oceanic regions (32.4%, risen from 4%). The early-life histories of tropical marine species are commonly researched, and thus this increase focus on tropical connectivity patterns is not unexpected.

![The oceanic regions used in the reviewed studies](../figs/oceanic_region.png){#fig:ocean_regions}

The models used different time-scales of oceanographic data depending on the trends of interest (inter- or intra-annual). Studies trended towards running the BDM over a handful of years (median = 3 years), with the majority using a single year in their connectivity study (26.9%). One study used the average of multiple years input data to interpret mean connectivity patterns [@Feutry:2013je]. Other outliers included studies investigating climate change scenarios, which used periods of 60 years [@Aiken:2011fx] and 130 years [@Andrello:2014ge]. In these studies, the earliest year modelled was 1950, and the latest year modelled was 2100 (using ocean current data based on past averages). The average of the dates modelled was a start date of 2001 with an end date of 2008. Although not all models used continuous years as input choosing rather to use specific years. As high powered computing becomes more readily available and with the known variability between consecutive years in hydrodynamic modelling, the trend for BDMs should hopefully be towards using longer periods of ocean data as input, though there is little evidence for this trend over the past 20 years based on Miller and this review. Its important to move in this direction as modelling longer periods of time allows for inter-annual comparisons of connectivity patterns.

## How connectivity studies are parameterising the physical model
The choice of oceanographic model depended upon the study region. The two most common ocean circulation models used were the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS; 25.3%) and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; 17.3%). Nested circulation models were used in the more complex particle trackers (16.2%) to bypass issues of low resolution in modelling. Miller's (2007) showed in their review the majority of studies used Finite Element Models (FEM; 20%) or Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM; 12.9%) and ROMS was chosen by only 7.1% of studies. It shows a trend towards open-source models, which are readily available on the Internet and present day connections allow for expeditious download times. The mean resolution used in these connectivity models was 5.6km^2^, with the finest resolution 50m^2^ [@Brennan:2014fm] to the coarsest resolution of 33km^2^ [@Crochelet:2013kr]. The mean resolution is half that of Miller's 2007 review (10.8km^2^), so while within studies there was no trend over time to higher resolution models, between reviews hydrodynamic precision increased.

The tracking time-step for larvae in the system (environmental forcing) were either fixed time-steps or varied per other factors. Runge-kutta fourth-order integration allows for interpolating the larvae accurately at smaller time-steps than the time interval used in the physical model and was used in 48.1% of the studies (usage could be higher as 33.8% of the studies did not specify the integration scheme used). The median time-step was one hour, and ranged between 60 seconds [@Moritz:2013dc] and 24 hours [@Mora:2012kn]. Miller (2007) reported the same median time-step, with similar ranges, except the maximum value found in that review was 48 hours. The time-step used was not reported in 37.3% of the studies. No clear rationale was given for the choice of time-step amongst the studies, likely determined by the choice of physical model and computational reasons.

## How connectivity studies are parametrising the biological model
The biological parameters implemented were not consistent across studies, apart from: pelagic larval duration (PLD; 100%) and spawning behaviour (98.3% - as mentioned previously there was a single hindcast study where spawning is not applicable; @tbl:behaviours). This was expected, as these traits are fundamental to connectivity studies for marine larvae, as they need to be spawned somewhere and there must be a time specified for the pelagic phase before the larvae can settle. A reason for the lack of consistency in the other traits and behaviours captured by the biological models could be that researchers do not believe that these traits and behaviours have much influence on connectivity patterns. This reason seems unlikely given the recent publications acknowledging the influence of behaviour on connectivity patterns. The more likely explanation is that there is not enough knowledge about the early-life history of many marine species, making parametrisation of the model difficult for certain traits and behaviours.

### Pelagic larval duration
The studies we reviewed exhibited two different approaches when implementing the pelagic larval duration. The standard approach (92.4% of models) was to make the PLD value fixed for each larva. If the individual larva reaches this time, it either must settle (if possible) or it is considered dead. The other approach was to implement variability in the PLD (5.6% of models), either using a Gaussian distribution (based on knowledge of the population) or instead of using time, make the PLD dependent on ocean temperature. The fixed PLD values ranged from a brief 2 days to a prolonged 420 days, with a median of 30 days. The PLDs were taken from known ranges found in the literature where available, with the longest PLDs occurring for invertebrate species e.g. the long duration (~400 days) of the phyllosoma stage of lobster larvae [@Butler:2011wu; @Kough:2013fa].

### Settlement competency window
PLDs were often used in conjunction with a settlement competency window (48.7%). The settlement competency window gives the marine larvae a period in which they can settle before they reach the end of their pelagic larval duration. It is based on their known biology, where possible, incorporating the idea that most species with a pelagic larval phase must develop sufficiently before the pelagic stage can finish. The range of start dates for this window were from day 0, meaning the larvae can settle from birth, up to 152 days. The median start date when the larvae were considered developed enough to settle was 9 days.

### Spawning strategies
A second fundamental element, included by necessity, in every study in our review was a spawning strategy, which determined how the larvae were released in the model. The spawning strategy was typically dependent on the biology of the modelled taxa and included pelagic eggs, demersal eggs, or brooding. To implement these different strategies, studies changed depth for the release of the larvae, e.g. demersal eggs were released on the bottom of the natal reef and pelagic eggs were released higher up the water column. The two strategies for releasing the particles at depth were either to use a fixed depth (37.5%), or to randomly release the larvae over a range of depth values (60.8%), i.e. release larvae in in the 0-20 m range of the water column. The timing of when larvae were released varied from hourly intervals [@Jacobi:2012cz], daily [@Kough:2013fa], monthly [@Staaterman:2012ek], on lunar cycles [@Davies:2014cw] or a one-off spawning event [@Herbert:2011bh]. The spawning windows relied on the known biology and what times of year the species is known to produce larvae. Typically the spawning events were pre-determined, but several studies used temperature as a spawning initiation [@Andrello:2014ge; @Rochette:2012io] or even wave height was used to release abalone larvae in one model [@Miyake:2011hr]. The release sites and settlement sites were the same for most studies. However, several studies (15.6%) used a limited set of key release sites with more available settlement sites. The larvae spawned at each site ranged from 10 larvae up to 10 million, with a median of 6,800. The total larvae tracked in the system (spawning site multiplied by the number of sites multiplied by the number of releases) had a similarly large range, from 328 to 610 million larvae, with a median total of 3.2 million. To simplify tracking these large numbers of larvae in the system, five studies (6.5%) used a super-individual concept, whereby a single larva in the system represents a sizeable number of larvae with a normalised collection of attributes. There are large computational benefits to this approach, especially in models that use a continuous space. The caveat is that you must consider how much individual variation you are willing to lose by modelling these super-individuals.

### Mortality and growth
Larval mortality was implemented in only 41% of the models (@tbl:behaviours). However, the implementation of mortality varied across the models, with the most common mortality function used was a linear function (82.2%), whereby a fixed percentage of the larvae were killed each day. The daily mortality rate in these studies varied from 1.7% to 30.0% with an average of 19.4%.  Other  mortality implementations were to kill the larvae based on a known temperature or salinity threshold (7.9%), using a decay function that decreased mortality based on age (7.9%) or using a Weibull function (2.1%). Unlike in Miller's 2007 review, where growth was implemented in one-third of the studies, only 6% of the models reviewed had the ability for larvae to grow (@tbl:behaviours). The rationale is that the models used in this review are solely investigating connectivity, where growth is not considered such an important factor affecting the strength of connectivity amongst sites, unless it is co-implemented with a sinking velocity dependent on mass.

### Behaviour
The degree to which larvae can behave, specifically sense, orient and swim directionally (vertically or horizontally) is a fundamental concern in broader field of larval biology which has potentially important ramifications for connectivity. As discussed previously, this has been recognised in the world of BDMs, with general support for the inclusion of such behaviours. In this review we classified models according to which of the four major larval behaviours were implemented; no movement (passive movement), movement (e.g. horizontal or vertical swimming), orientation (ability to orientate towards a reef using cues) and settlement (settle at a site using a sensory buffer or sticky zones).

Larvae were given the ability to move in 26% of the models, conversely in 74% of the models the larvae were assumed to be passive and moved solely using the physical model. Miller (2007) observed that 43% of the fish studies in the reviewed papers implemented a facet of larval behaviour, thus the percentage of BDM studies implementing larval behaviour is decreasing. Of the behaviours classified as movement, diel vertical migration was the most commonly implemented behaviour (45.4%; @tbl:swimming). Ontogenetic vertical migration, the idea that marine species change their vertical position in the water column as a factor of their ontogeny, was used in 27.2% of the models. Horizontal swimming was implemented in 12.5% of the models, although it must be mentioned that random movement to mimic turbulence does capture an extent of undirected horizontal swimming. A smaller number implemented vertical swimming in the larvae (4.5%). Other movements included in models were prompted by environmental conditions such as tides (circatidal migration 5.7%,), salinity (halocline migration; 1.1%), or migrating with the pycnocline (6.8%). Another movement implementation, as mentioned above, was using sinking velocity (3.4%) in conjunction with growth, e.g. the heavier the larvae the faster it sinks. The last strategy involved giving the pelagic eggs a buoyancy (4.5%) based on the salinity level in the water column, thus they can float at different vertical migrations.

| Swimming behaviour            | Implemented (%) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Horizontal swimming           | 12.5            |
| Vertical swimming             | 4.5             |
| Ontogenetic vertical swimming | 27.2            |
| Diel vertical migration       | 45.4            |
| Halocline migration           | 1.1             |
| Circatidal migration          | 5.7             |
| Pycnocline migration          | 6.8             |
| Sinking velocity              | 3.4             |
| Egg buoyancy                  | 4.5             |

The ability of the marine larvae to sense settlement habitat was implemented in 50.9% of the models. Of these, 95.4% opted for a buffer zone implementation, where each settlement site has a buffer added to it, increasing its size. The mean size of the buffer zone was 8.18 km (SD = 5.2 km). The other implementation, which essentially works on similar principles, was to give the larvae a detection distance relative to the centre of the settlement site [@Staaterman:2012ek]. This settlement cue was used to allow the larvae to orientate towards the reef if the larvae was within the cue distance ranging between 1-10 km (median distance was 5 km), with a combination of early and late onset orientating abilities.

For the studies modelling fish, the implementation of only passive movement decreased over the reviewed period. In 2015, for the first time there were more studies using movement behaviours than other forms of behaviour (@fig:fish_prop). Implementation of settlement sensory strategies remain constant over the published time period. Interestingly, the ability of fish to orientate towards settlement sites was only found to be implemented in one study in 2012. For invertebrates, there is no real change over time in the pattern of implemented behaviours (@fig:invert_prop).

![The proportion of behaviours in the published fish studies by year](../figs/fish_prop.png){#fig:fish_prop}

![The proportion of behaviours in the published invertebrate studies by year](../figs/invert_prop.png){#fig:invert_prop}

This finding is extremely interesting from a biological viewpoint. There is empirical knowledge of fish behaviour influencing the outcome of connectivity [@Leis:2006kf; @Cowen:2009fm], BDM studies demonstrating that connectivity changes with behaviour, and studies suggesting the way forward is to include behaviour [@Staaterman:2014ee; @North:2009tx]. However, there are still many studies including models with no implemented behaviour at all - passive larvae were used in 75% of model configurations. There is also a well established body of empirical literature which highlights the often extensive swimming abilities of ichthyoplankton [@Leis:2006kf; @Leis2010325]. Even where horizontal swimming is not important, it is well understood zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration patterns to below the mixed layer, hypothesised due to predator avoidance [CITE]. Several studies in the review showed that vertical migration (either diel or ontogenetic) increased self-recruitment and limit the dispersal kernel [@Young:2012gb; @Aiken:2011fx]. Orientation was only implemented in one study, yet there is an increasing body of research in the last decade regarding the ability of reef fish larvae to orientate towards natal reefs using olfactory mechanisms [@Gerlach:2007gw], celestial cues [@Leis:2014es; @Faillettaz:2015dn] and a magnetic compass [@Bottesch:2016hl].

One possible reason for not implementing behaviour is that the complete (or even partial) early life history is often unknown for many species and researchers are trying to avoid using any behavioural assumptions in their models. Fish larval behaviour is known to be species specific, yet many models are limited to using known data from the family taxonomic level due to the lack of knowledge on a particular species. It was been argued that this approach is fraught with danger, as behaviour can vary widely amongst species within a family taxonomic grouping [@Leis2010325]. The lack of species specific knowledge poses the question, can we only model species where we fully understand the early life history, or is there a degree of assumption that is deemed to still be scientifically valid to answer the study question.

## The metrics used to describe connectivity
There was a lot of variation in the metrics used to describe the results of the connectivity studies. There were more than 25 different measures used to describe the patterns of dispersal and settlement. The common approaches were to use combinations of dispersal kernels (64.0%) and connectivity matrices (57.2%; @tbl:common_metrics). Less common measures of model output were larval centre of mass (average geographical position of the larvae; 2.6%) [@Lacroix:2013cf; @Miyake:2011hr], isotropy (describes the inertia around the centre of mass; 1.3%) [@Ayata201018], positive area (number of areas that had larvae in them, 1.3%) [@Puckett:2014cx], and proportion of sites settled (1.3%) [@Robins:2013ih].

The trend in biophysical modelling is to present data using visual techniques such as heat maps, which while being effective tools for visually communicating complex patterns qualitatively, make it difficult to pull out quantified data points. The most common connectivity values reported in the the reviewed studiesâ€“when a connectivity matrix was presentedâ€“were self-recruitment (39.9%), local retention (35.3%) and global settlement success of larvae (23.9%; @tbl:common_metrics). However, while these response metrics were explicitly described, we were only able to extract actual values from 70.0%, 62.0%, and 42.0% of the studies in which connectivity matrices were described for self-recruitment, local-retention and settlement success respectively.

Based on the extracted data, there was a large spread of the mean self-recruitment amongst the models, ranging from 0-98%, depending on the study, with a median self-recruitment percentage of 13.0%. Local retention, while mentioned for 31.7% of studies, we were only able to get mean local retention values for 5.5% of the models. Mean local retention ranged from 0.3-46.0%, with a median value of 6.0%. Overall mean settlement success of the larvae was extracted for 18.0% of the studies, ranging from 0.1-80% successful settlement rates, with a median of 17.0%. The mean dispersal distance was obtained for 15.2% of the studies with a median value of 78.2 km (range of 9.1-952 km).To put these values into context for a site *x* - from all the larvae spawned at site *x*, 17.0% of them successfully settled at site in the system, of which 5.5% settled back to site *x*. For all larvae that settled at site *x*, typically 13.0% of them originated at site *x* and each particle travelled about 78.2 km.

The high percentage of successfully settled larvae per model is unusual, much higher than we expected. It was expected that the settlement success would be extremely low, even if mortality is not included in the system. Perhaps because many studies have reported potential connectivity instead of realised connectivity (realised is a more accurate measure offset by biological processes such as egg production and mortality). The large ranges amongst the metrics for self-recruitment, local retention and settlement success, was also unexpected. However, the large range of input parameters must be responsible for such variations - in the next section we explore how these modelling decisions affect these common metrics.

# Influence of modelling decisions on connectivity values
As indicated above, much of the variation observed in connectivity values and patterns across the reviewed study will be driven by modelling environments and especially parameterisation decision. Below we attempt to use the body of reviewed literature to assess the impact of various model and parameter choices on resulting connectivity values. As indicated in the methods section above, we have restricted consideration to only those model characteristics/input parameters and output connectivity metrics that were shared amongst the majority of studies. Specifically we look at the impact four modelling environment characteristics (choice of model, model resolution, model design and study system) and four biological parameterisation decisions (larval duration, competency window, larval mortality and movement behaviour) on four key metrics of connectivity (self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success & dispersal distance). Note there are situations where there were not enough data points to make valid comparison of specific connectivity metrics.

## Modelling environment

### Model choice
There appears to be no clear pattern between choice of either physical or BDM model and the four common metrics (@fig:bdm_metrics; @fig:physical_metrics). The BDM model CMS had consistent reported self-recruitment values between studies, but highly variable settlement success. The PTM has higher values than the median for self-recruitment, settlement success and dispersal distance. Icthyop had low settlement success values, except for two studies. Studies using HYCOM and POM had the largest ranges amongst the metrics. ROMS and HANSOM had the least variation of metrics for the common hydrodynamic models.

*Note: Potentially reduce these graphs to the most popular models (put the cut-off at 5%?)*

### Model resolution
There was a significant positive predictive relationship between model resolution and local retention (r^2^=0.82, F(1,17)=79.11, p\<0.05), but no relationship between model resolution and self-recruitment (r^2^=0.05, F(1,57)=2.75, p\>0.05), settlement success (r^2^=0.01, F(1,64)=0.77, p\>0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^=0.01, F(1,51)=0.69, p\>0.05). This was unexpected given that sub-mesoscale processes are expected to be more accurately captured in the hydrodynamic model as the resolution increases (spatial scale decreases), as would the connectivity patterns of the modelled larvae, e.g. increasing self-recruitment as small eddies trap larvae close to natal reefs. Local retention increases as model resolution gets coarser, which is difficult to explain in absence of no relationship with self-recruitment or settlement success and model resolution.

#### Nested model design
The self-recruitment at natal sites was significantly reduced (28.8% versus 0.9%) when nested models (i.e. sub-models with higher resolution near settlement sites) were used (t=7.15, df=49.13, p\<0.05), however, caution should be used when evaluating this result due to the large unbalance between the groups (only 10 models describing self-recruitment had nested designs versus 50 which did not). There was no significant difference in the settlement success or dispersal distance when using nested models, and there were no studies using nested models where we were able to get local retention values. Again, the results are not expected, as similar to above, increasing model resolution theoretically increases self-recruitment and local retention, while decreasing the dispersal distance.

### Open systems vs closed systems
There was no evidence that the geographic openness of the modelled system was consistently affecting the connectivity results derived from the models. While both self-recruitment and settlement success (38% and 22% higher respectively) were greater in closed system, the difference was not significant (self-recruitment: t=1.24, df=16.49, p\>0.05; settlement success: t=0.97, df=64, p\>0.05).  This result is unexpected given the presumably elevated rates of larval loss in open systems, but it should be noted that the samples sizes here are small. Of course, this lack of difference could also be indicative of researchers appropriately choosing the boundaries of the modelled systems based on the biology of the modelled taxa. In this case, even seemingly open systems, may in fact be demographically more similar to geographically (and thus also demographically) closed ones. Dispersal distance was 3.4 times longer in open systems, compared to closed (t=-3.75, df=41.82, p\<=0.05). This can be explained by the geographical nature of an open system, potentially allowing more larvae to be dispersed away from settlement sites and into large oceanic features. There were not enough data points on local retention for a meaningful comparison.

## Biological parameterisation

### Pelagic larval duration
Local retention to the natal site showed a significant positive relationship with the length of PLD (r^2^=0.57, F(1,16)=20.95, p\<0.05), although there were not enough data points to be confident of this relationship. There was no relationship with either self-recruitment (r^2^=0.02, F(1,54)=1.12, p\>0.05) or settlement success (r^2^=0.05, F(1,59)=3.08, p\>0.05). There was a significant positive relationship with PLD (r^2^=0.23, F(1,45)=13.63, p\<0.05), although it explains only about 25% of the variation found in dispersal distance. Other studies have shown a relationship between PLD and dispersal distance [CITE]. It is interesting that pelagic larval duration does not appear to influence self-recruitment or settlement success at all. Suggesting that the evolutionary pressures for longer pelagic larval duration is being able to disperse further, combined with other potential factors such as increased size before settlement to reduce recruitment mortality.

### Settlement competency window
The settlement competency window, dependent on the pelagic larval duration, was strongly negatively correlated with local retention (r^2^=0.70, F(1,9)=20.83, p\<0.05) and weakly positively correlated with self-recruitment (r^2^=0.27, F(1,18)=6.69, p\<0.05). The was no significant relationship with settlement success (r^2^=0.09, F(1,24)=2.39, p\>0.05) or dispersal distance (r^2^=0.04, F(1,19)=0.75, p\>0.05). The opposite result was expected, specifically that increasing the settlement competency window would increase both the settlement success of the larvae and the dispersal distance, by giving them more chances to find settlement sites. If there is no relationship with settlement success and the settlement competency window, it is unusual that there would be relationships with both self-recruitment and local retention and even more unusual that they have opposite directions in their relationships, since we know they are proportional to each other [@Lett:2015ff]. For all of these analyses the degrees of freedom were low which could account for the anomalies.

### Mortality
Models which included mortality had similar levels of self-recruitment (t=-1.54, df=58, p=\>0.05) and settlement success (t=0.70, df=64, p\>0.05) to models run without mortality (@fig:mortality_metrics). Including mortality also had no effect on the dispersal distance of the marine larvae (t=-1.16, df=9.13, p\>0.05). There was a significant difference in local retention when mortality was applied compared to when it was not (t=-3.65, df=4.30, p\<0.05). Mortality did reduce the variation of the settlement success and the dispersal distance (apart from two outliers) values, which was expected. The variation of self-recruitment values increased, which would occur if settlement success also decreased, as less larvae would be arriving from other sites. Local retention, while going up with mortality, which is an expected results, again there are not enough data points to draw strong conclusions.

![Comparing models that implemented mortality with self-recruitment, local retention, settlement success and dispersal distance values](../figs/mortality_metrics.png){#fig:mortality_metrics}

### Movement behaviours
The inclusion of movement or settlement sensory abilities reduced the self-recruitment of a model (@fig:behaviour_metrics). While the data indicates including both of them increases self-recruitment, this is likely due to a low number of data points. There were slight increases for including either movement or settlement sensory behaviour in the models, but including both movement and settlement greatly increased the settlement success seen the model (@fig:behaviour_metrics). Local retention was not reported much for studies including movement behaviours, therefore not many conclusions can be drawn from the data. Dispersal distance did not change with movement added, the dispersal distance had increased variability when settlement sensory was included in the model. The ability to sense a settlement site favours particles that have travelled far from the natal site. Potentially sensory zones can overcome coarse near-shore hydrodynamic modelling issues, increasing settlement of larvae. Although when movement and sensory ability was included, this variation was greatly reduced. Unfortunately there was not enough data on models with orientation to get a good understanding how it affects the four metrics, but the strong assumption is that it would also increase settlement success, as shown in individual studies [@Staaterman:2012ek].

# Conclusion and recommendations
The popularity of BDMs as a connectivity research tool has been on a downward trend since 2012. However, the implementation of them appears to be getting more complex, especially for ichthyoplankton, where for the first time in 2016 there were more models with movement than without. The proportion of studies using settlement sensory strategies was consistent across the review period for models of either fish or invertebrate species, not keeping up with the trend in implementing movement. Therefore it appears researchers are heeding the recommendations of publications such as the ICES manual, and other research showing the importance of movement in influencing connectivity patterns.

This study has shown there was the large spread of values reported for these studies. There range for within each of the common measures; self-recruitment, local-retention, settlement success, and dispersal distance was considerable. The likely explanation is due to the non-trivial amount of parameter choices to be made in BDMs, many of which are optional or species specific. These are complex systems and as such it is not easy to standardise the output. Seemingly obvious explanations such as open/closed systems did not explain the variance. Another potential key driver is the inherent variability of the oceanographic currents, which we know to be huge influence on connectivity patterns [@Cowen:2009fm]. Model resolution seemingly had no effect on the connectivity patterns metrics, although using a nested design did reduce self-recruitment. Increasing the size of the settlement window, thus allowing larvae to settle at an earlier, increased local retention and self-recruitment. Mortality did not seem to affect the connectivity metrics, although including both movement and a sensory ability to select a settlement site, increased settlement, self-recruitment and the distance travelled by larval.

The current state of the field feels like is not moving forward as coherently it should be. Studies have been calling for behaviour to be implemented for nearly 10 years, however, many studies are still not including larval behavioural traits such as movement - although this is changing. This is despite the evidence that behaviours do change the described connectivity patterns. Obviously there is a problem with the lack of empirical evidence for many marine species, and this should be a priority research area. The second priority to is provide clarity in metrics so we can meaningfully compare the outcomes of connectivity studies and progress the field further. A consistent approach, including providing underlying data would assist in progressing the field for future comparisons, allowing us to understand why there is so much variation amongst reported measures of connectivity.
