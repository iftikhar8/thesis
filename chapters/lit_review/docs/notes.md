Talk about the ICES manual and are people meeting those conditions? Are we moving forward properly as we should? What is holding us up? 

We know that behaviour influences connectivity patterns. How do we utilise this? Is the problem that we do not have enough information about early life histories or is it just that models are not implementing this enough in their work? 

This is what I want to get out of this. WHERE TO FROM HERE. Obviously also talk about the metrics and how comparisons are difficult. What are the minimum standards? The field seems to be a bit lost as what to do. 

Table: Spatial scales and temporal scales. Comparisons of what trends. Also inter vs. intra annual. What sorts of studies are people doing? This can be a 3 way table. 

Mention about how studies are trying to use empirical data to validate these models! 

Ichthyoplankton (from Greek: ἰχθύς, ikhthus, "fish"; and πλαγκτός, planktos, "drifter") are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are usually found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. (Source: Wikipedia)


The conclusion should:
summarise the important aspects of the existing body of literature;
evaluate the current state of the literature reviewed;
identify significant flaws or gaps in existing knowledge;
outline areas for future study;
link your research to existing knowledge.


##Behavior and Settlement
Butler IV shows OVM reduces dispersal distance, also gives other examples with lobster larave


##Mortality
If only we know the mortality. The difference between potential and realised connectivity could be great with high mortality, see Butler IV highlights. 


##Background
This review focuses on biophysical connectivity models. 

-What is a biophysical model? 
-When did we start utilising them? 
-The ICES manual was released in 2009, have people been implementing models using this paper? It has a suite of recommendations. Want to evaluate if the field is moving forward at all, or are we just making the same mistakes. 
-What are they used for?

Biophysical modelling is a field that is 30 years old, although the physical model is more mature than its coupled biological model.



#Figures Use
(NB = no behaviour, M = movement, S = settlement sensory, MO = movement and orientation, MS = movement and settlement sensory, OS = orientation and settlement sensory, MOS = movement, orientation & settlement sensory)
