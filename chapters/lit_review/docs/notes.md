Talk about the ICES manual and are people meeting those conditions? Are we moving forward properly as we should? What is holding us up? 

We know that behaviour influences connectivity patterns. How do we utilise this? Is the problem that we do not have enough information about early life histories or is it just that models are not implementing this enough in their work? 

This is what I want to get out of this. WHERE TO FROM HERE. Obviously also talk about the metrics and how comparisons are difficult. What are the minimum standards? The field seems to be a bit lost as what to do. 

Table: Spatial scales and temporal scales. Comparisons of what trends. Also inter vs. intra annual. What sorts of studies are people doing? This can be a 3 way table. 

Mention about how studies are trying to use empirical data to validate these models! 

Ichthyoplankton (from Greek: ἰχθύς, ikhthus, "fish"; and πλαγκτός, planktos, "drifter") are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are usually found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. (Source: Wikipedia)
