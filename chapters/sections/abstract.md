# Abstract

In marine systems, connectivity is defined as the exchange of individuals between spatially distinct populations. For most marine populations, this connectivity occurs during the pelagic larval phase of a species, whereby prevailing currents are able to transport larvae considerable distances to settle amongst new populations. Increasingly, research has found that species-specific biological traits, e.g. vertical migration and orientated horizontal swimming, can influence where larvae settle. Biophysical dispersal models (BDMs) — a hydrodynamic model coupled with a biological model — lend themselves to inferring potential connectivity patterns, as empirical studies using current methods are inherently difficult over extended spatial and temporal scales. For BDMs to become mature research tools, it is important to understand what are the important parameters in predicting connectivity patterns, i.e. what traits modellers should focus on including. Producing accurate models, leading to better understanding of the connectivity between marine populations has important conservation implications in the design of marine protected areas. The intent of this thesis was to explore the biological processes that affect the connectivity patterns of ichthyoplankton. The first chapter is a meta-analysis of connectivity studies using BDMs was undertaken to investigate both trends and consequences of modelling choices on connectivity. Considerable variation was seen amongst the four common metrics (local retention, self-recruitment, settlement success and dispersal distance) that were used for comparison of different parameters to identify their influence. While comparisons between BDM studies is difficult due to the high number of modelling choices and no identifiably standard metrics for reporting connectivity patterns, some patterns for both physical and biological modelling choices were discerned. The results of this meta-analysis provide a useful framework on parameters choice for future consideration of connectivity studies. The second chapter is an experiment measuring the ontogenetic vertical migration of reef fish off the coast of south-eastern Australia. The ichthyoplankton of seven reef-associated families were collected off the NSW coast at three different depths (0-5m, 5-50m, 50-100m), and assessed for ontogenetic stage (pre-flexion, flexion or post-flexion) and measured for total length (mm). Vertical migration patterns were found to different between each family. Overall, the ichthyoplankton sampled were found to migrate deeper with both increasing ontogenetic stage and increasing length. The only family that displayed an opposite trend was Mullidae. There was no change in ontogenetic vertical distribution between coastal or eddy waters, however, eddies entrained more developed and longer larvae. The third chapter is a theoretical modelling chapter that investigates the effect of different swimming behaviours: no swimming, diel vertical migration (DVM), ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM), and orientated horizontal swimming (OHS), and differences in the parameterisation and implementation of OVM in a BDM. The most influential behaviour on connectivity patterns along the coastline of south-eastern Australia was OHS. Changing implementation of OVM had a stronger effect on connectivity patterns than the strategy of OVM. The fourth chapter, synthesising these results from the previous three data chapters, explored the predicted connectivity patterns of an endemic and threatened Australian reef fish, the black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*) using a BDM. *E. daemelii* larvae were strongly connected to both the natal and proximate regions. Using graph theory, four sub-populations were identified, three along the coast of NSW, separated by latitude, and an off-shore population comprised of Elizabeth Reef, Middleton Reef, and Lord Howe Island. In context with the current marine protected area (MPA) network of NSW, strong settlement regions of regions with known aggregating populations had only moderate or no sanctuary zone coverage (i.e. no-take areas). Comparing the MPA network with the connectivity across the entire known distribution, identified regions were additional protection could be beneficial to the recovery of the  *E. daemelii* population, e.g. Yamba. The results of this thesis increase our understanding of the influence of behaviour on connectivity patterns and identifies methods for researchers to advance BDM studies, with the aim of leading to greater realism across derived connectivity patterns.
