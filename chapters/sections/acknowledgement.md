Acknowledgements
================

Wow. What a journey.

I would like to acknowledge my supervisor, A/Prof Will Figueira for all the help and support he has given me over the last four years (even though he supports Duke?!). Especially since moving to Singapore, remote student management and ensuring I keep motivated has most likely not been an easy task. As a supervisor, he put in more hours than required to help me get this PhD over the line.

To all the other students of CMEG, past and present, who have offered support, guidance, laughs, coffee breaks, and much needed *Flodge* times over the course of this PhD. This research has allowed me to meet amazing people from all over the world, making great friends along the way, something I will always be grateful for.

I would like to acknowledge the CSIRO and the Investigator team, along with chief scientist Iain Suthers for allowing me to participate on the voyage that became Chapter 3. For assistance with all the ichthyoplankton identification (many long hours in the Suthers laboratories at UNSW) many, many thanks to Dr. Tony Miskiewicz aka "Miskie" aka "The Godfather", and Valquiria Garcia. Who knew there was so much to learn about the morphology of larval fish. 

I am thankful I received a Australian Postgraduate Award to support this research and also received funding from the School of Life and Environmental Sciences to attend and present my work at conferences in Sydney, Canberra, Geelong, Darwin, and New Orleans.

To my friends and family for all the support during this PhD, e.g. shouting beers, having to listen to me rabbit on about the wonders of larval fish, and keeping me motivated when I needed it most. And a shout out to the Forum for keeping me sane. A PhD is journey along a long and winding road and you cannot do it alone.. Even though they will never read this thesis, it would not be possible without the support of those close to me.

Lastly, I would like to thank my amazing wife, Daphne Goh, whom without her support this PhD would not have been possible.
