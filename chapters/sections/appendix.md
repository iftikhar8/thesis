### Table B1

: Proportional depth stage abundance profiles for each of the seven fish families evaluated in Chapter 3. Values represent the proportional (within a stage) abundance of each stage within each of three depth ranges (surface: 0-5 m; mixed layer: 5-50 m; deep layer: 50-100 m) and are used to parameterise models run to address Aim 2 of this study.
