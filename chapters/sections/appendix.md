![Comparison of the total settlement to source regions for the different models within the behaviour scenario (Passive = no behaviour, VA = vertical advection, DVM = diel vertical migration, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration; OHS = orientated horizontal swimming). Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase1-cluster.png)

Comparing the connectivity of the behavioural models to settlement region, cluster analysis of the settlement regions by behavioural models produced two distinct clusters; models with and without OHS (Figure B6 A). Within the OHS cluster, models without vertical migration behaviour (regardless of the use of vertical advection) were highly similar. In the non-OHS cluster, the most dissimilar model was DVM. Across both clusters, models with OVM were more similar than models with DVM. In the non-OHS cluster, the passive models and the OVM models were grouped (Figure B6 A). The settlement patterns of the models OHS and OHS with VA were homologous, in contrast to the dissimilarity of the settlement patterns from the passive and passive with VA models.

Comparisons of the connectivity to settlement regions using CCA analysis also produced two clusters, similar to the CAP analysis on the entire connectivity matrix (Figure B6 B; Figure B6 C). However, the dissimilarity between models within a cluster displayed opposite patterns, whereby using the total settlement OHS models were less similar than the non-OHS models (excluding DVM). The models with OHS are more dissimilar to each other using total settlement as compared to the analysis using regional settlement patterns. The variation between behaviour scenario models was explained by a combination of settlement regions (Figure B6 B). OHS models had increased settlement at regions 1, 2, 3, and 16 and decreased settlement at the regions 5, 6, and 10.

Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase2-cluster.png)

Two clusters were identified when comparing the total settlement of the different migration strategies. The first cluster contained only [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14041" author="Reviewer 1"}strategy 2[]{.comment-end id="14041"}, and the second comprised all the other OVM strategies (Figure B7 A). Within the latter group the sub-groupings were based on strategy, with one sub-group consisting of a strategy that migrated deepest with increasing ontogeny (strategies 5 and 6), and the other group using the OVM strategy whereby the centre of mass is in the 5-50 m depth layer at postflexion [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14042" author="Reviewer 1"}(strategies 1, 3, 4, and 7)[]{.comment-end id="14042"}. The differences in the total settlement were driven by small regional changes, with the most notable effect of increased settlement at region 1 for the OVM strategies that migrated deeper with ontogeny (Figure B7 B).

Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase3-cluster.png)

Comparisons of total settlement to regions found time step to have the most dissimilar settlement patterns (Figure B8 A). The differences were again driven by small regional differences, most notably an increased settlement at region 1 for stage and time step compared to the daily migration model (Figure B8 B).

![The metrics of mean settlement richness (A; a measure of the number of regions settled), settlement diversity (B; a measure of richness and abundance using the Shannon-Weiner index), and connectance (C; a measure of describing the proportion of all links between the natal and settlement sites that are realised) for each region, as measured for each modelling scenario grouped by the three aims; behaviour (Passive = no behaviour, VA = vertical advection, DVM = diel vertical migration, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration; OHS = orientated horizontal swimming), OVM strategy, and OVM method. The whisker plots denote the mean, one standard deviation either side of the mean and min/max values.](chapters/theoretical/figs/settle-metrics.png)

Settlement richness was decreased when OHS or DVM behaviour was in a model, but increased with OVM behaviour (F~7,144~ = 17.50, p \< 0.05; Figure B9 A). The settlement diversity showed a similar effect as behaviour on richness, with OHS and DVM reducing diversity (F~7,144~ = 18.79, p \< 0.05; Figure B9 B). The variation of settlement diversity between regions was increased with OHS and DVM. Connectance was highest for the models with only OVM behaviour or the passive models, and lowest for models with OHS behaviours (Figure B9 C). DVM behaviour was observed to reduce the connectance between regions. Different OVM strategies did not produce any differences in richness (F~(6,96)~ = 1.11, p > 0.05; Figure B9 A) or diversity (F~(6,96)~ = 0.79, p > 0.05; Figure B9 B). The strategies with the lowest connectance occurred [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14044" author="Reviewer 1"}with strategies 1 and 4, while strategy 7[]{.comment-end id="14044"} had the highest connectance values (Figure B9 C). OVM methods did not have an effect on settlement site richness (F~(2,32)~ = 1.04, p \> 0.05; Figure B9 A) though there was an effect on diversity (F~(2,32)~ = 11.02, p < 0.05; Figure B9 B). This effect was caused by the OVM method of daily migration, which had lower settlement site diversity than the other OVM methods. However, the daily method of migration had the highest value of connectance (Figure B9 C). Differences in behaviour were more influential in determining the settlement richness, diversity, and connectance between regions (Figure B9). Diversity was impacted more by changes in OVM method than the strategy choice (Figure B9 B).
