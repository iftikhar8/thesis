![Comparison of the total settlement to source regions for the different models within the behaviour scenario (Passive = no behaviour, VA = vertical advection, DVM = diel vertical migration, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration; OHS = orientated horizontal swimming). Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase1-cluster.png)

Comparing the connectivity of the behavioural models to settlement region, cluster analysis of the settlement regions by behavioural models produced two distinct clusters; models with and without OHS (Figure C6 A). Within the OHS cluster, models without vertical migration behaviour (regardless of the use of vertical advection) were highly similar. In the non-OHS cluster, the most dissimilar model was DVM. Across both clusters, models with OVM were more similar than models with DVM. In the non-OHS cluster, the passive models and the OVM models were grouped (Figure C6 A). The settlement patterns of the models OHS and OHS with VA were homologous, in contrast to the dissimilarity of the settlement patterns from the passive and passive with VA models.

Comparisons of the connectivity to settlement regions using CCA analysis also produced two clusters, similar to the CAP analysis on the entire connectivity matrix (Figure C6 B; Figure C6 C). However, the dissimilarity between models within a cluster displayed opposite patterns, whereby using the total settlement OHS models were less similar than the non-OHS models (excluding DVM). The models with OHS are more dissimilar to each other using total settlement as compared to the analysis using regional settlement patterns. The variation between behaviour scenario models was explained by a combination of settlement regions (Figure C6 B). OHS models had increased settlement at regions 1, 2, 3, and 16 and decreased settlement at the regions 5, 6, and 10.

Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase2-cluster.png)

Two clusters were identified when comparing the total settlement of the different migration strategies. The first cluster contained only [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14041" author="Reviewer 1"}strategy 2[]{.comment-end id="14041"}, and the second comprised all the other OVM strategies (Figure C7 A). Within the latter group the sub-groupings were based on strategy, with one sub-group consisting of a strategy that migrated deepest with increasing ontogeny (strategies 5 and 6), and the other group using the OVM strategy whereby the centre of mass is in the 5-50 m depth layer at postflexion [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14042" author="Reviewer 1"}(strategies 1, 3, 4, and 7)[]{.comment-end id="14042"}. The differences in the total settlement were driven by small regional changes, with the most notable effect of increased settlement at region 1 for the OVM strategies that migrated deeper with ontogeny (Figure C7 B).

Cluster analysis (A) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure and clustered using the average-link method and constrained correspondence analysis (B) using Euclidean distance metrics. ](chapters/theoretical/figs/phase3-cluster.png)

Comparisons of total settlement to regions found time step to have the most dissimilar settlement patterns (Figure C8 A). The differences were again driven by small regional differences, most notably an increased settlement at region 1 for stage and time step compared to the daily migration model (Figure C8 B).

![The metrics of mean settlement richness (A; a measure of the number of regions settled), settlement diversity (B; a measure of richness and abundance using the Shannon-Weiner index), and connectance (C; a measure of describing the proportion of all links between the natal and settlement sites that are realised) for each region, as measured for each modelling scenario grouped by the three aims; behaviour (Passive = no behaviour, VA = vertical advection, DVM = diel vertical migration, OVM = ontogenetic vertical migration; OHS = orientated horizontal swimming), OVM strategy, and OVM method. The whisker plots denote the mean, one standard deviation either side of the mean and min/max values.](chapters/theoretical/figs/settle-metrics.png)

Settlement richness was decreased when OHS or DVM behaviour was in a model, but increased with OVM behaviour (F~7,144~ = 17.50, p \< 0.05; Figure C9 A). The settlement diversity showed a similar effect as behaviour on richness, with OHS and DVM reducing diversity (F~7,144~ = 18.79, p \< 0.05; Figure C9 B). The variation of settlement diversity between regions was increased with OHS and DVM. Connectance was highest for the models with only OVM behaviour or the passive models, and lowest for models with OHS behaviours (Figure C9 C). DVM behaviour was observed to reduce the connectance between regions. Different OVM strategies did not produce any differences in richness (F~(6,96)~ = 1.11, p > 0.05; Figure C9 A) or diversity (F~(6,96)~ = 0.79, p > 0.05; Figure C9 B). The strategies with the lowest connectance occurred [**Major** 1404]{.comment-start id="14044" author="Reviewer 1"}with strategies 1 and 4, while strategy 7[]{.comment-end id="14044"} had the highest connectance values (Figure C9 C). OVM methods did not have an effect on settlement site richness (F~(2,32)~ = 1.04, p \> 0.05; Figure C9 A) though there was an effect on diversity (F~(2,32)~ = 11.02, p < 0.05; Figure C9 B). This effect was caused by the OVM method of daily migration, which had lower settlement site diversity than the other OVM methods. However, the daily method of migration had the highest value of connectance (Figure C9 C). Differences in behaviour were more influential in determining the settlement richness, diversity, and connectance between regions (Figure C9). Diversity was impacted more by changes in OVM method than the strategy choice (Figure C9 B).

Settlement richness differed between regions, showing similar patterns to the other connectivity metrics (F~(18,126)~ = 7.12, p < 0.05; Figure D2 A). The mean number of regions settled each year over the time series ranged from 6.75 at Newcastle, up to 15.25 for EM Reefs. The central source regions of NSW had the lowest richness values. Port Macquarie had the highest richness of the source regions along the coast. Annual variation of settlement richness occurred in all regions but was larger for the southern and offshore source regions. The diversity also differed between regions; however, it showed a different pattern than richness (F~(18,126)~ = 24.85, p < 0.05; Figure D2 B), declining from regions Tweed to Nambucca, and a more random pattern from Port Macquarie to Eden. Diversity was highest at Lord Howe Island, with the next group identified by post-hoc tests being EM Reefs, Tweed, and Byron. The offshore reefs had the largest variation of diversity, suggesting a strong effect of year in these regions, and Port Macquarie had the highest variation amongst the coastal regions. The diversity of settlement patterns from Sydney and Crowdy Bay exhibited the least annual variation.

Annual variation of settlement richness was found amongst the connectivity patterns (F~(7,126)~ = 5.79, p < 0.05; Figure D3 A). Settlement richness was lowest in the years 2008, 2011, and 2006, and peaked in 2007; however, the variation between years was minimal. The settlement diversity was also different between years, but with less variation than the richness (F~(7,126)~ = 3.81, p < 0.05; Figure D3 B). The years of highest diversity were 2010 and 2004, and the lowest was 2005, 2011, 2008 and 2006.
