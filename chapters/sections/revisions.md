### Annotated comments

#### Abstract

**Comment 1:** This sentence is a bit awkward. Combining two models by itself isn't really why they are complex.
*Response:* Clarified in R1AC01.

**Comment 2:** It's not so much what they should include but also on how sensitive model predictions are to parameter values.
*Response:* Clarified in R1AC02.

**Comment 3:** Accuracy and precision imply some empirical data for model verification/validation. Perhaps you mean increasing the realism of models, both from a physical and biological perspective!
*Response:* Clarified in R1AC03.

**Comment 4:** Grammar error
*Response:* Fixed in R1AC04.

**Comment 5:** Grammar error
*Response:* Fixed in R1AC05.

#### Introduction

**Comment 1:** Very minor point by ichthyoplankton disperse and when this results in settlement into another population results in the populations being connected (i.e. larvae are not connected, populations are!).
*Response:* Clarified in comment R1AC101.

**Comment 2:** (Mortality) Some recent studies by Will White and Darren Johnson suggest this estimate might be a bit high....
*Response:* Clarified by mentioning the range in estimated larval survivorship in comment R1AC102.

**Comment 3:** (Settlement competency) Worth describing this in more detail, particularly in relation to settlement competency, given that it is a larval trait that has been shown to influence connectivity predictions from BDMs.
*Response:* Clarified in comment R1AC103.

**Comment 4:** (Spawning on dispersal) I agree that it's important but I don't think there is sufficient evidence to suggest it's more important that other traits such as PLD and mortality rate.
*Response:*: Clarified the statement to make it clear it is one of several processes in comment R1AC104.

**Comment 5:** (Ocean processes) Seems contradictory to what you've just said. Need to clarify.
*Response:*: Clarified to ensure it relates to only the physical processes in comment R1AC105.

**Comment 6:** (Length of PLD) Need to explain how.
*Response:*: Clarified that is allows the larvae more time to choose where to settle in comment R1AC106

**Comment 7:** (Recruiting with siblings) This could be a physical process (although I agree that it's more likely to be behavioural)...
*Response:* Clarified that it is more of a potential source of evidence in comment R1AC107.

**Comment 8:** This paragraph is a bit of a list of traits without much connectivity (excuse the pun!). It could use with a bit of a rewrite to improve flow.
*Response:* I refocused the paragraph to be on dispersal, more so than connectivity. And then I fleshed out the next paragraph on the benefits of connectivity, see comment R1AC108.

**Comment 9:** This section is pretty underdeveloped. There is a rich literature on the value of connectivity in assessing MPA network performance and recent modeling and empirical data to support this. This section should be fleshed out more to help bolster the value of this sort of information to inform MPA planning.
*Response:* Expanded the section (and added more references) to contain more information on the design and planning on MPAs using connectivity, see comment R1AC109.

**Comment 10:** There have been quite a few reviews of these methods, none of which have been referenced, which is surprising. There is quite a lot of discussion of the strength and weaknesses of different approaches and over what spatial and temporal scales they are most suited to. A more critical analysis of this literature and a stronger argument made for why a BDM approach was most appropriate in the context of this thesis would make for a more compelling introduction to the thesis.
*Response:* Addressed this be restructuring the paragraph to make the argument in the final paragraph. Also included more information on the benefits of using BDMs, see comment R1AC110.

**Comment 11:** Don't think this contributes much as it's all rehashed in more detail in the following paragraphs in this section.
*Response:* TODO



## Reviewer 3

### Abstract

**Comment 1:** For fishes, not really sessile, which implies no movement post-settlement, but rather of limited post-settlement movement (site-attached in many cases), particularly compared to the pelagic stage
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC101

**Comment 2:** This ref deals only with the morphology.You need refs for habitat and behaviour
*Response:* Added reference from edited book on reef fish ecology relating to habitat and behaviour. See comment R3AC12.

**Comment 3:** (Fecundity) Life-time? Annual? Spawning episode?
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC103.

**Comment 4:** Even the smallest larvae have some swimming ability, but it is generally only postflexion stages that have meaningful swimming abilities in the context of dispersal
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC104.

**Comment 5:** And how do you define the start of the juvenile stage?
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC105.

**Comment 6:** (PLD) You have a contradiction here - if the larvae turn into juveniles before they settle - all depends on how you define juvenile.  You are mixing morphological and ecological definitions, which always confuses people.  Best to define end of PLD as when settlement occurs (not when the larvae settle)
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC106.

**Comment 7:** (PLD) the PLD or the settlement stage?
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC107.

**Comment 8:** (PLD) but not at higher taxonomic levels!
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC108.

**Comment 9:** (PLD) also, things like food supply and temperature have an effect, which is perhaps what you mean by physiological limitations.  There are also likely to be genetic factors that differ among individuals involved
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC109.

**Comment 10:** (Processes) some may disagree - what about behaviour, mortality, etc?  Unless, of course, one assumes passive dispersal
*Response:* Addressed in comment R1AC104.

**Comment 11:** What is a contributing process?
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC111.

**Comment 12:** or, put differently, PLD has not proved to be a robust predictor of dispersal distance
*Response:* Clarified in comment R3AC112

**Comment 13:** (Ichthyoplankton) use of the word plankton, even in combination bears the inherent implication of passivity wrt swimming.  Suggest you avoid use of the term in the context of this thesis and dispersal
*Response:* Point taken that planktonic = passive, removed the references to ichthyoplankton. Clarified in comment R3AC113, but also across the entire thesis.

**Comment 14:** Pelagic environment is a better term rather than 'plankton'.  Some may argue that pelagic=oceanic, but it does not.  It simply means in the water column with no implication of where or what the swimming abilities of the animal are
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC114.

**Comment 15:** influence is a better term, as this may also increase dispersal distance in some cases
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC115.

**Comment 16:** enables
*Response:* Fixed in R3AC116.

**Comment 17:** (Settlement) maybe, but  no one really knows.  maybe they irreversibly start to metamorphose at a certain stage, and it is obviously mal-adaptive to have a demersal type morphology in the pelagic environment.
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC117.

**Comment 18:** per generation
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC118.

**Comment 19:** possibly 'current' is not the best term to use here, as it could be confused with water movement, as in techniques for measuring currents
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC119.

**Comment 20:** by definition, it also will only tell you about genetic connectivity, which you told us your thesis is not about
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC120.

**Comment 21:** of course an estimate can be made with even smaller numbers, but how reliable, precise or accurate is it?
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC121.

**Comment 22:** labour-intensive
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC122.

**Comment 23:** and inherently more complex and variable
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC123.

**Comment 24:** ichthyoplankton is the early life-history stage of fishes, it has no early life-history stage of its own
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC124.

**Comment 25:** indirectly influence - vertical distribution and changes therein can only indirectly influence dispersal outcomes, as opposed to swimming (and orientation) which can directly influence it.
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC125.

**Comment 26:** at best include only hypothetical OVM behaviour in the absence of empirical information.
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC126.

**Comment 27:** dispersal, not connectivity. It is populations or metapopulations that are connected [by dispersal], not the fish larvae. 
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC127.

**Comment 28:** if you consider sparids and sciaenids to be reef fishes, then  this ref is relevant
Leis JM, Hay AC, Trnski T (2006) In situ behavioural ontogeny in larvae of three temperate, marine fishes. Mar Biol
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC128.

**Comment 29:** (Vertical advection) do you mean upwelling?
*Response:* Clarified in R3AC129.
