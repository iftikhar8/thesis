### Abstract

**Comment 1:** This sentence is a bit awkward. Combining two models by itself isn't really why they are complex.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1001.

**Comment 2:** It's not so much what they should include but also on how sensitive model predictions are to parameter values.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1002.

**Comment 3:** Accuracy and precision imply some empirical data for model verification/validation. Perhaps you mean increasing the realism of models, both from a physical and biological perspective!
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1003.

**Comment 4:** Grammar error
*Response:* Fixed in comment: Minor 1004.

**Comment 5:** Grammar error
*Response:* Fixed in comment: Minor 1005.

### Introduction

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** Very minor point by ichthyoplankton disperse and when this results in settlement into another population results in the populations being connected (i.e. larvae are not connected, populations are!).
*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor1101.

**Comment 2:** (Mortality) Some recent studies by Will White and Darren Johnson suggest this estimate might be a bit high....
*Response:* Clarified by mentioning the range in estimated larval survivorship in comment Minor1102.

**Comment 3:** (Settlement competency) Worth describing this in more detail, particularly in relation to settlement competency, given that it is a larval trait that has been shown to influence connectivity predictions from BDMs.
*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor1103.

**Comment 4:** (Spawning on dispersal) I agree that it's important but I don't think there is sufficient evidence to suggest it's more important that other traits such as PLD and mortality rate.
*Response:*: Clarified the statement to make it clear it is one of several processes in comment Minor1104.

**Comment 5:** (Ocean processes) Seems contradictory to what you've just said. Need to clarify.
*Response:*: Clarified to ensure it relates to only the physical processes in comment Minor1105.

**Comment 6:** (Length of PLD) Need to explain how.
*Response:*: Clarified that is allows the larvae more time to choose where to settle in comment Minor1106

**Comment 7:** (Recruiting with siblings) This could be a physical process (although I agree that it's more likely to be behavioural)...
*Response:* Clarified that it is more of a potential source of evidence in comment Minor1107.

**Comment 8:** This paragraph is a bit of a list of traits without much connectivity (excuse the pun!). It could use with a bit of a rewrite to improve flow.
*Response:* I refocused the paragraph to be on dispersal, more so than connectivity. And then I fleshed out the next paragraph on the benefits of connectivity, see comment Minor1108.

**Comment 9:** This section is pretty underdeveloped. There is a rich literature on the value of connectivity in assessing MPA network performance and recent modeling and empirical data to support this. This section should be fleshed out more to help bolster the value of this sort of information to inform MPA planning.
*Response:* Expanded the section (and added more references) to contain more information on the design and planning on MPAs using connectivity, see comment Minor1109.

**Comment 10:** There have been quite a few reviews of these methods, none of which have been referenced, which is surprising. There is quite a lot of discussion of the strength and weaknesses of different approaches and over what spatial and temporal scales they are most suited to. A more critical analysis of this literature and a stronger argument made for why a BDM approach was most appropriate in the context of this thesis would make for a more compelling introduction to the thesis.
*Response:* Addressed this be restructuring the paragraph to make the argument in the final paragraph. Also included more information on the benefits of using BDMs, see comment Minor1110.

**Comment 11:** Don't think this contributes much as it's all rehashed in more detail in the following paragraphs in this section.
*Response:* Deleted and restructured the text, see comment Minor1111.

### Chapter 2

#### Major comments

**Comment 1:** You limited the review to studies published since 2007 but this limits your analysis of the impacts of model parameter values on dispersal outcomes. A particular issue was your search string; restricting your search to only pick up studies that used ‘connectivity’ instead of the more general term ‘dispersal’ means you likely missed a reasonable number of relevant studies. Given your interest specifically in investigating the metrics of local retention, self-recruitment, dispersal distance and settlement success, these would have been more useful search terms than just connectivity. I would also have searched using multiple databases, particularly Google Scholar so you would have picked up papers that used these terms in the text.
*Response:* The scope of the search terms were broadened slightly to use "connectivity, model\*, larva\*", and google scholar was included as a searched database. This results in an increase to 132 published studies (previously 75), with 589 models (previously 367). However, increasing this number had a negligible change on the overall trends found in the review. Perhaps using dispersal instead of connectivity would have produced a greater number, however many dispersal studies often do not have settlement (primarily focusing on the drift of the larvae), which would not have added to our metrics. Dispersal studies that include settlement should use the word connectivity within the text, which would be expected to be picked up in the search. This number of studies should be sufficient to find the general trends we are after considering the aims behind this review.

**Comment 2:** I was concerned over the choice of statistic tests. Models are not independent of publication. This is a fundamental issue in meta-analyses and you need to account for the nested nature of your data. The fact that ~25% of your models were from one study (Treml et al. 2015) and for one particular model platform and for one particular region of the world is a significant issue. Furthermore, how a particular model parameter influences a particular dispersal outcome is not independent of all of the other aspects of the particular studies and the models used, yet you performed separate tests. The fact that many of these relationships were weak or NS, is not surprising given the complexity and variability in how models were configured. There are a variety of ways that you can account for this in meta- analyses, such as using linear mixed effects models, which allow for testing of more complex models, evaluating the particular effects of particular parameters more independently and accounting for the nested structure of the data, and funnel plots to test for publication bias. Many reviewers will also require documenting how studies were screened, such as a PRISMA flow diagram.
*Response:* Yes I understand the nested nature of the data, however I felt as the aim of the paper is not to draw strong conclusions and hard interpretations, instead to look for general patterns, then this analysis was suitable.

The single Treml *et al.* 2015 paper was reduced to 16% when considering the new amount of models, and also it was not used for any metrics analysis and not data for the common metrics was obtained from that paper. The number of papers with common metrics was 67 (200 models). Of these, there was a mean of 3 (± 3.5) models per paper. The mean is skewed by a few papers having over 10 models with extracted data, and 32 papers that only had one model.

This is the first time I have heard of the PRISMA flow, and I agree that is a useful procedure for documenting the workflow of screening studies in a review. It is hard to implement this now, but I agree it should be done and I will use this workflow for future reviews.

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** Poor grammar.
*Response:* Fixed in comment: Minor 1201.

**Comment 2:** How did you arrive at this number? There are a reasonable number of studies that predate this one.
*Response:* Found another paper 4 years prior, so have clarified in comment: Minor 1202.

**Comment 3:** How you scored each trait for each model is not clear. You should have a table that outlines how this was done.
*Response:* I did not provide scores to traits, had columns for each trait (150 columns in total) and listed true / false if it was mentioned with in the body of the article (or supplementary information).

**Comment 4:** (Analysis) It's unclear when your treating a study as a replicate or an different paramaterised model as a replicate?
*Response:* Clarified in Minor 1204.

**Comment 5:** (Tropical or Temperate) How much of this is simply because of the Treml et al. 2015 paper?
*Response:* This analysis was performed on studies (not models) and therefore it is only 1 paper out of 131.

**Comment 6:** (multiple years) What evidence is there that this matters? What about matching the time frames to durations of larval release? What's know about that?
*Response:* Agreed that for studies investigating genetic connectivity, a single year might suffice (if there is not much variation between years). For demographic connectivity, it is known that timing of spawning and location is an important factor in dispersal events, also many modelling studies have shown large annual variation. Therefore it is ideal to model more than a single event. I clarified this statement in comment: Minor 1206.

**Comment 7:** This is somewhat worrying! This is a great paper but this is one modelling framework for one particular study domain.
*Response:* The new number of models has reduced this down to 16.8%.

**Comment 8:** (Modelled taxa) What are the implications of this result? You don't discuss it at all.
*Response:* Added a statement on the potentially broader interpretations of results with generic values, see comment: Minor 1208.

**Comment 9:** What do you mean by spawning behaviour? This is too vague. So is saying they had a PLD (what was it based on, was it fixed or variable, etc). Perhaps this could be defined in a table earlier.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1209. TODO create a table?

**Comment 10:** (Biological traits) There is a whole range of ways in which this functionality could be implemented, some of which will be biologically meaningful and others not. This seems to be an important distinction which you haven't made. What implications do you think this has for what conclusions you can draw from this analysis?
*Response:* TODO

**Comment 11:** (Number of particles) So what does this mean? What are the implications? There isn't much synthesis here and the reader doesn't know if any of this is important or not.
*Response:* TODO Clarified in comment: Minor 1211

**Comment 12:** I'm struggling with your sample sizes for different analyses. I thought there were 367 unique models. If so then the total for this panel is quite off.
*Response:* Yes, that should read "studies" and not "models". Clarified in comment: Minor 1212

**Comment 13:** This raises the question of how studies treated larvae which left the model domain.....
*Response:* This is a good point, and one that was rarely mentioned amongst the reviewed studies. Clarified in comment: Minor 1213

**Comment 14:** How did you account for the fact that many of model characteristics are likely to co-vary (for example model resolution and study system).
*Response:* I did not account for this - I was interested in general patterns without over interpreting the results. While yes this is probably true, there will also often be choices, e.g. what system, what model (and what resolution) to make.

**Comment 15:** I'm not convinced this is a useful comparison. There is no a priori expectations for differences among models. It's all about who, where, and how....
*Response:* TODO: Explain.... Clarified in comment: Minor 1215.

**Comment 16:** (Model resolution) You need to be careful with these comparisons as none of these studies tested the impact of model resolution within the same modelling study. Furthermore, studies that have looked at this question have actually found more local retention but also greater dispersal distances, so it's not actually that straightforward. Regardless, it's worth looking at studies that have specifically looked at resolution when controlling for all of the other inter-study differences that make this comparison difficult
*Response:* TODO Clarified in comment Minor 1216.

**Comment 17:** These are some pretty questionable models, given the data distributions.
*Response:* TODO: Yes, these models and the lack of relationships have been addressed.

**Comment 18:** There is no OS category in this figure.
*Response:* Fixed in comment Minor 1218.

**Comment 19:** Hmm. This is not a very defensible argument. Given the limited data set and the numerous factors that are different between studies in additional to model resolution, I don't think you can actually say much about whether coarsely resolved models provide realistic estimates of dispersal patterns. Hydrodynamic models have to be validated first to see if they are capturing the physics well enough to properly characterize the advection and diffusion of larvae.
*Response:* Yes I agree, and I have hedged my bets more on the argument. Clarified in Minor 1219.

### Discussion

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** Given this justification, it would have been interesting for you to evaluate this literature as to whether they actually followed the guidelines! My guess is that most haven't.
*Response:*: TODO

**Comment 2:** What's important is to include complexity that is biological realistic and then to test how sensitive model outcomes are to parameter values. Building a fully complex model to investigate which aspects of biology or behaviour are important can then help drive where the key research needs are in terms of getting realistic parameter values. This is what we need more of.*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1602.

**Comment 3:** Some discussion of interactions among behaviours is worth having. OVM, DVM, and OHS are all likely to interact and change with development.
*Response:* Added a line for the possible explanation of interactions, see comment Minor1603.

**Comment 4:** It's also worth talking about how what you observed off the NSW coast at the time of year you sampled could have influenced your findings. How structured was the water column and how does this compare to other studies of vertical larval distributions? 
*Response:* Addressed the temporal variation in comment: Minor 1604. Comparisons of water column were added to the data chapter in TODO

**Comment 5:** This conclusion is going to be very sensitive to the speeds used, how they change with ontogeny, and what decision rules are used for their implementation. Given this, it would be good to review your scheme versus others (not just the two studies you cite) and compare the implementations and outcomes of those decisions. One of the worst papers I ever read was one with Wolanski, where the OHS implemenation was so strong that all larvae could go wherever they wanted so the decision rule implemented completely dominated the model outcome!
*Response:* Added a paragraph about other implementations and the differences in swimming implementations, see comment Minor1605.

**Comment 6:** Yes, but swimming is used for many things and probably more related to predator-prey interactions than dispersal. We are far from being able to implement directional swimming behaviour in models with a level of realism!
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1606.

**Comment 7:** This is not necessarily an issue with off-line models. It's just an issue with what time step was used in the original model. Some can have time steps that capture dynamic processes that are relevant to dispersal.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 1607.

**Comment 8:** That's not really true. The problem is that most disperal modelling has used physical models developed by oceanographers but there are lots of models developed by coastal engineers that are at the scale relevant to larval dispersal (although the domains of many of these models tend to be too small for the research question).
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 10708.

**Comment 9:** Again, need to be careful about how a physical model has been validated. The empirical data used is often at a scale much larger than the question and rarely involves verification of dispersion via advection and diffusion, but comparisions to current velocities in a few locations or proxies for circulation using remotely sensed data (temp, ocean colour, sea-surface height anomalies, etc).
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 10709.

**Comment 10:** There is another really good paper for this: Domingues et al. 2012 Plos One 7 (4), e35794
*Response:* Included the paper in the manuscript, see comment Minor10710.

**Comment 11:** The above sections are good and important. Others have argued for having standard reporting. The ICES guidelines that you reference as the basis for the starting date for your meta-analysis is a good one. It would be worthwhile comparing. Are your points the same as this guideline? If not, what's different and why is this important?
*Response:* Included a brief summary of how the ICES manual's recommended practices are reflected with the reviewed models. The ICES manual is more a publication focusing on guidelines of how to implement models more than specific recommendations on what should and should not be included, see comment Minor10711.

### General

#### Minor comment

**Comment 1:** I’m not sure if you’re aware, but von Braun was responsible for war crimes during the second world war. If not for Operation Paperclip, he would have been tried at Nurenberg. Seeing him quoted was a little jarring.
*Response:* Addressed, I cannot say I was aware of his history, and I have chosen a more appropriate quotation.

### Introduction

#### Major comment

#### Minor comment

**Comment 1:** Page 3: Perhaps change “Evidence of active dispersal” to “The influence of active dispersal is suggested by”. High self-recruitment and sibling recruitment to the same location are not necessarily evidence of active dispersal ability, since either could be explained by alternative, passive dispersal mechanisms.
*Response:* Addressed in reviewer comment Minor1107.

**Comment 2:** Page 4: Dynamic marine protected areas are also proposed as fisheries management tools to maximise catches. E.g., Game et al. (2009; Ecology Letters; Hobday & Hartmann 2006, Fish Man & Ecol). Moreover, traditional fisheries management in places like Fiji have been using dynamic marine reserves for centuries.
*Response:* Included a sentence on the other functions of marine protected areas, see comment Minor2103

**Comment 3:** Generally speaking, I found the in-line ordering of citations confusing – neither chronological nor alphabetical in many cases.
*Response:* Yes, there was an issue with the XML I was using to generate the in-line citations. I have fixed the error now and they use the Harvard reference notation.

**Comment 4:** Page 6: “and therefore constant monitoring must (occur to???) confidently predict dispersal using otoliths”
*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor2105.

### Chapter 2

#### Major comments

**Comment 1:** I liked the way this chapter thought strategically about the parameters we use in BDMs, and about the metrics we use to summarise complex connectivity patterns. Framing the paper as a reflection on the progress we’ve made as a field of BDM modellers is also useful, as well as timely. On a micro-scale, I thought that the arguments made about each of the particular associations were to-the-point and rational, and the analyses were cautious and careful. The analyses weren’t complex – most were simple regressions and distribution comparisons – but that’s probably appropriate given the limitations of the data available. On a macro-scale, my main concern is that I didn’t see enough careful explanation about the ideas behind the analyses in the chapter. By this I mean the following. Connectivity patterns are dependent on oceanographic context. Metrics such as “dispersal distance” will vary between systems. As an extreme example, if a system has only a single habitat patch, it’s impossible to have a dispersal distance greater than zero. So it’s not clear what you get when you compare 50 models that measure dispersal-distance in very different systems where you would expect those factors to vary. So when you regress dispersal distance against PLD, or model resolution, how strong do you expect that signal to be? What does it mean not to see a relationship? I don’t think these issues preclude the analyses described in this chapter, but I do think that they demand much closer attention, much stronger overall justification, and a long and thoughtful limitations section in the discussion. This chapter did not undertake this sort of serious reflection. I realise that there was a lot of caveats scattered throughout the text, and I appreciated those. However, I’m talking about are more philosophical and concentrated reflection (generally in the discussion or introduction) on what you might expect to see from this style of analysis.
*Response:* TODO: Add limitations section in the discussion.

**Comment 2:** As a general point, I think that the traits you use to characterise the models fall into two bins. Factors that need to be controlled for (i.e., is the oceanography open or closed), and factors that can be selected for inclusion by the modeller, and which therefore need to be understood better. I found that to be a useful filter through which to view your results.
*Response:* Yes, this can be true for some facets of the oceanography. Even with the hydrodynamic model there is often no choice for the modeller, only what is available.

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** Page 14: I was surprised that you omitted papers published before North’s ICES paper. I would have been interested to see how the inclusion of parameters changed before and after their recommendations. Although I guess your goal was not to test the impact of that single paper. Although on the other hand, if it wasn’t centred around the impact of that specific paper, why not extend the review further back along the timeline of BDMs?
*Response:* The goal was to see if, with the provision of guidelines, models have been getting more complex since the paper was introduced. With the advent of technology as well, going back too far also can mean you start comparing apples with oranges. I wanted to limit the effect of using more sophisticated hydrodynamic models (e.g. better eddy resolving reanalyses), along with the benefits of computing power that allow for more parameters to be included in the BDM without hindering the time to run the model. Ten years can be a long time in computing power, and modelling choices in earlier studies could have had to make choices based on memory and CPU demands that are not so much an issue today (especially with most universities having HPC access).

**Comment 2:** Page 20: I understand what you’re saying, but “linear” is not the way to describe a model where a fixed percentage of the larvae died each day. The number of larvae remaining alive at time t in this model is exponentially decaying, not linear. The number dying each day is constant, not linear.
*Response:* I have changed this to constant, clarified in comment: Minor 2202

**Comment 3:** Page 26: What do you mean by “better connectivity patterns”? More accurate?
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 2203

**Comment 4:** Page 27: “This suggests that the you can get accurate overall settlement and dispersal distance with coarser models”. I think it suggests that accuracy will not decrease with coarser models, but not that either resolution provides “accurate” predictions, necessarily.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 2204

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** For fishes, not really sessile, which implies no movement post-settlement, but rather of limited post-settlement movement (site-attached in many cases), particularly compared to the pelagic stage*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3101

**Comment 2:** This ref deals only with the morphology.You need refs for habitat and behaviour*Response:* Added reference from edited book on reef fish ecology relating to habitat and behaviour. See comment Minor312.

**Comment 3:** (Fecundity) Life-time? Annual? Spawning episode?*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3103.

**Comment 4:** Even the smallest larvae have some swimming ability, but it is generally only postflexion stages that have meaningful swimming abilities in the context of dispersal*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3104.

**Comment 5:** And how do you define the start of the juvenile stage?*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3105.

**Comment 6:** (PLD) You have a contradiction here - if the larvae turn into juveniles before they settle - all depends on how you define juvenile. You are mixing morphological and ecological definitions, which always confuses people. Best to define end of PLD as when settlement occurs (not when the larvae settle)*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3106.

**Comment 8:** (PLD) but not at higher taxonomic levels!*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3108.

**Comment 10:** (Processes) some may disagree - what about behaviour, mortality, etc? Unless, of course, one assumes passive dispersal*Response:* Addressed in comment Minor1104.

**Comment 11:** What is a contributing process?*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3111.

**Comment 12:** or, put differently, PLD has not proved to be a robust predictor of dispersal distance*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3112

**Comment 13:** (Ichthyoplankton) use of the word plankton, even in combination bears the inherent implication of passivity wrt swimming. Suggest you avoid use of the term in the context of this thesis and dispersal*Response:* Point taken that planktonic = passive, removed the references to ichthyoplankton. Clarified in comment Minor3113, but also across the entire thesis.

**Comment 14:** Pelagic environment is a better term rather than 'plankton'. Some may argue that pelagic=oceanic, but it does not. It simply means in the water column with no implication of where or what the swimming abilities of the animal are*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3114.

**Comment 15:** influence is a better term, as this may also increase dispersal distance in some cases*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3115.

**Comment 16:** enables*Response:* Fixed in comment: Minor 3116.

**Comment 17:** (Settlement) maybe, but no one really knows. maybe they irreversibly start to metamorphose at a certain stage, and it is obviously mal-adaptive to have a demersal type morphology in the pelagic environment.*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3117.

### Introduction

#### Major comments

**Comment 1:** I would like to see the author’s view on the following questions. Did the author see any trend in his review toward multiple use of what is essentially the same model in different publications? Or, does each investigator reinvent the wheel and develop his/her own model? Regardless of the answer, what does this say about the state of the art of dispersal modelling?
*Response:* (short answer). No. (unless it just included passive movement).
(long answer).

**Comment 2:** In this chapter, there are many instances of repetitive testing, and no apparent correction for this. I would not expect an overall correction for all the tests within the chapter, but within the several tests for each element, this needs consideration. Some argue that the standard ‘correction’ for repetitive testing is inappropriate, and there is some justification for this view. The alternative is to provide the actual p value for each test (rather than just < 0.05 or >0.05), to allow the reader to assess things for themselves. The author has done neither. This issue must be addressed by the author in some manner in this chapter.
*Response:* I was correcting for the behaviour comparisons (using a Tukey correction), but yes I agree it should be used for all the multiple comparisons. I have also put in the exact p-values for the reader to assess. For each metric I have now used an adjusted p-value (labelled p~adjusted~) using the technique described in @pike2011. This has been explained better in the methods under the clarified comment: Major 3202.

#### Minor comments

**Comment 1:** Why?  Surely, the importance of different parameters depends on the species and the locality.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3201.

**Comment 2:** prevoiusly, it was in the first person singular.  Why now in the first person plural??
*Response:* Yes, there were some inconsistencies between the paper and the thesis chapter. I have rectified these.

**Comment 3:** (Model reuse) upon what basis was this confidence based?  Any tests of model predictions based on some independent empirical data set?  Or, just go with the herd?
*Response:* TODO

**Comment 4:** surely, it cannot be true that ELH of temperate spp is not commonly researched.  Perhaps you are referring to particular aspects of ELH.  If so, then what?
*Response:* TODO

**Comment 5:** Few models can be truly predictive in the sense of trying to say what will happen in the future, as they require input of the physical drivers, such as wind patterns that are not known in advance.  This is worth saying explicitly
*Response:* TODO

**Comment 6:** (decreasing movement in models) Rather retrograde situation
*Response:* TODO

**Comment 7:** (Ichthyoplankton) if they have extensive swimming ability, they can't be considered plankton
*Response:* Changed to larval fish.

**Comment 8:** by definition, velocity is a vector consisting of both speed and direction
*Response:* Removed the redundant parenthesis explanation.

**Comment 9:** Even using known behaviour involves some assumptions.  I think you mean they are avoiding using any entirely hypothetical behaviour
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3209.

**Comment 10:** I'm not sure that this is the most appropriate way to look at it - first, it would be per larva, not larvae, but more to the point, it is per model, not per larva.  I suggest you rephrase to simply drop the per larvae phrase, and say: the median value was 75.6 km (range of...
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3210.

**Comment 11:** And of course, the topographic setting.  At an oceanic island, one would expect more offshore dispersal than found within the Great Barrier Reef.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3211.

**Comment 12:** in other words, the models, can, at best predict dispersal to the potential settlement location, but not connectivity, which includes post-settlement processes
*Response:* Agreed, the actually connectivity between populations cannot be predicted, just the mechanism that allows for it (dispersal). Clarified in comment: Minor 3212.

**Comment 13:** favourable in what sense?  To moving offshore?  Of course, this would depend on the behavioural abilities of the larvae, both horizontal swimming, and whether moving vertically might produce offshore movement
*Response:* Favourable in that they get a current velocity that will not move them onshore. Clarified in Minor 3213.

**Comment 14:** (Grammar) something missing here
*Response:* Fixed in Minor 3214.

**Comment 15:** why?  To what extent that the models each dealt with a different location/system contribute to the wide ranges?
*Response:* The large ranges were surprising due to what was seen in the literature. Clarified in Minor 3215.

**Comment 16:** Not a logical alternative - I think you might mean lower or equal, but the question is compared to what, presumably than an open system.  Be more explicit
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3216.

**Comment 17:** to their natal patch,
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3217.

**Comment 20:** there are lots of other places they could have gone
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3220.

**Comment 21:** Not sure what you mean here.  Are you saying that local retention and dispersal distance varied little among models, but that settlement success and self-recruitment did vary?
*Response:* Yes that is what I was trying to say. Clarified in comment: Minor 3221.

**Comment 22:** predicted values, models can only predict
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3222.

**Comment 23:** Better in what sense?  Were they tested in some manner and shown to be close to some empirical measure?
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 2203.

**Comment 24:** Citation?  Is there any evidence to support this theory?  or is it simply a hope?
*Response:* Clarified with a citation in comment: Minor 3224.

**Comment 25:** Not sure I follow this bit.  Clarify

**Comment 28:** decreased with...but decreased compared to what? 

**Comment 30:** predictions of
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3230.

**Comment 31:** Need to explain why only some relationships are shown with regression lines, and what I assume are confidence intervals. You have tested only linear relationships  - might some other ones provide better fits to the data?  See above for examples 
*Response:* Only the significant relationships were shown, but yes perhaps other relationships would be more appropriate (TODO) Clarified in comment: Minor 3231.

**Comment 32:** Citation needed
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3232.

**Comment 33:** What does this mean?
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3233.

**Comment 34:** Do you mean behavioural data, in particular?
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3234.

**Comment 35:** It is even more difficult to justify ignoring factors shown to be important in other studies where data on those factors are available.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3235.

**Comment 36:**  True that 'open' systems are not as open as supposed, but equally true that 'closed' systems are not as closed as supposed
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3236.

**Comment 37:** But you found only a weak relationship between PLD and dispersal distance, and admit that other studies (with real data, rather than only model predictions) have found no relationship
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3237.

**Comment 38:** This last is particularly odd
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3238.

**Comment 39:** True, but in the absence of any objective means of verifying model predictions, how can one have any confidence that this, or any other model prediction is any better or worse than any other?
*Response:* Agreed. Clarified in comment: Minor 3239.

**Comment 40:** What is needed is a means of testing model predictions in an objective way!
*Response:* TODO




#### Minor comments

### Discussion

**Comment 1:** a model cannot measure - it can only predict
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3601.

**Comment 2:** conspecifics are members of the same species. What better value could one want than that?
*Response:* Yes, clarified to mean at the genus and family level, see comment Minor3602.

**Comment 3:** this doesn't limit uncertainty - it ignores reality!
*Response:* Yes I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Clarified in comment: Minor 3603.

**Comment 4:** exclusion is a class of assumptions
*Response:* Yes, clarified in comment: Minor 3604.

**Comment 5:** which, of course, are highly correlated
*Response:* Yes, clarified in comment: Minor 3605.

**Comment 6:** such as...
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3606.

**Comment 7:** I think you mean to say that eddies contain older larvae of coastal fishes than do waters over the continental shelf for the simple reason that, once off the shelf, the eddies receive no further input of young larvae.
*Response:* Yes, I added the entrainment explanation, see comment Minor3607.

**Comment 8:** location and timing of spawning are also behaviours
*Response:* Clarified that I was talking about movement behaviours, see comment Minor3608.

**Comment 9:** on the other hand, your incorporation of swimming ability included quite a few assumptions
*Response:* True, removing some assumptions can inevitably create more, you hope the assumptions have less effect on the modelled outcome, see comment Minor3609.

**Comment 10:** somewhere in this section you need to clearly state that your conclusions can only be considered to apply to the region for which the model was built, or at best, for other similar locations (western boundary currents)
*Response:* Clarified in comment Minor3610.

**Comment 11:** major limitation that should have been highlighted previously
*Response:* TODO: Put in the other chapter.

**Comment 12:** I think you also used information from reared larvae, which is going to be different (ie, much longer for each developmental stage and for PLD) that for what happens in the wild
*Response:* Clarified in the statement Minor3612 (and in Chapter TODO)

**Comment 13:** assumptions will always be required, but we can hope that as time passes, they will become fewer, and more soundly based.
*Response:* Clarified in comment: Minor 3613.
