### Annotated comments

#### Introduction

**Comment 1:** Very minor point by ichthyoplankton disperse and when this results in settlement into another population results in the populations being connected (i.e. larvae are not connected, populations are!).

*Response:* Clarified in comment R1AC1.

**Comment 2:** (Mortality) Some recent studies by Will White and Darren Johnson suggest this estimate might be a bit high....

*Response:* Clarified by mentioning the range in estimated larval survivorship in comment R1AC2.

**Comment 3:** (Settlement competency) Worth describing this in more detail, particularly in relation to settlement competency, given that it is a larval trait that has been shown to influence connectivity predictions from BDMs.

*Response:* TODO

**Comment 4:** (Spawning on dispersal) I agree that it's important but I don't think there is sufficient evidence to suggest it's more important that other traits such as PLD and mortality rate.

*Response:*: Clarified the statement to make it clear it is one of several processes in comment R1AC4.

**Comment 5:** (Ocean processes) Seems contradictory to what you've just said. Need to clarify.

*Response:*: Clarified to ensure it relates to only the physical processes in comment R1AC5.

**Comment 6:** (Length of PLD) Need to explain how.

*Response:*: Clarified that is allows the larvae more time to choose where to settle in comment R1AC6

**Comment 7:** (Recruiting with siblings) This could be a physical process (although I agree that it's more likely to be behavioural)...

*Response:* Clarified that it is more of a potential source of evidence.

**Comment 8:** This paragraph is a bit of a list of traits without much connectivity (excuse the pun!). It could use with a bit of a rewrite to improve flow.

*Response:* TODO

**Comment 9:** This section is pretty underdeveloped. There is a rich literature on the value of connectivity in assessing MPA network performance and recent modeling and empirical data to support this. This section should be fleshed out more to help bolster the value of this sort of information to inform MPA planning.

*Response:* TODO

**Comment 10:** There have been quite a few reviews of these methods, none of which have been referenced, which is surprising. There is quite a lot of discussion of the strength and weaknesses of different approaches and over what spatial and temporal scales they are most suited to. A more critical analysis of this literature and a stronger argument made for why a BDM approach was most appropriate in the context of this thesis would make for a more compelling introduction to the thesis.

*Response:* TODO

**Comment 11:** Don't think this contributes much as it's all rehashed in more detail in the following paragraphs in this section.
