# Potential examiners

## Dr Eric Treml

Currently heading the foremost connectivity modelling group in Australia, and has published extensively in the area, including writing his own software for investigating these problems (MGET).

**Bio**

Topics: Quantitative ecology and conservation, marine ecology and environmental science, biophysical oceanography, population connectivity, biogeography, conservation prioritisation, network theory, and habitat change.
Quantitative skills: Dynamic biophysical modelling, spatial statistics, network analysis, geographic information system (GIS), programming, spatial modelling, bioinformatics, remote sensing, and high-performance computing (HPC). I have written over 6,000 lines of code in MATLAB, Python, R, ARC Macro Language (AML), and PBS/bash shell scripts (for HPC parallel computing).
Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET) software contribution: MGET is a free, open-source geoprocessing toolbox that provides support for a wide variety of marine research, oceanographic data access and analysis, conservation, and spatial planning problems. MGET site here

## Dr Johnathan Kool

Not sure if non-academics count, but Jonathan has vast experience in connectivity modelling. He would be a great examiner of all the modelling chapters, and as a programmer would provide good critique of the underlying model used within the thesis.

**Bio**

Johnathanâ€™s primary interests lie in investigating the processes responsible for generating large-scale patterns of diversity in marine ecosystems. To achieve this, Johnathan uses analytical methods and individual-based simulations to examine oceanographic dispersal over space and time. He is also trying to find ways to improve the integration of computer science and complexity research into conservation planning.

## Dr Jeffrey Leis

Jeff is the foremost guru on larval fish taxonomy in Australia, and therefore would be a good examiner of the empirical chapter (and perhaps its worthiness). He also has published studies on connectivity modelling, so provides a good input as to how the biology should be integrated etc.

**Bio**

Jeff Leis is an Adjunct Professor at the Centre for Ecology and Biodiversity at IMAS.  He works on the early-life history of marine fishes, in particular, the larval stages of demersal, coastal species. His research focuses on the identity and ontogeny of fish larvae, on the relationships of fishes, on the behaviour and sensory abilities of fish larvae, on the dispersal of marine fish larvae, and on the connectivity of populations of marine demersal fishes.

## Professor Steven Swearer

Also another larval fish biologist, with a keen interest in connectivity and conservation. So would be across all the sections of my thesis, with the ability to provide great feedback.

**Bio**

I am a Professor of marine biology at the University of Melbourne. At heart I am a larval fish biologist, with a keen interest in understanding how ecological processes that occur in early life influence the dynamics of populations. My research has recently taken a more applied focus by identifying the primary causes of extinction risk in fishes and coastal marine ecosystems, in order to inform better water, pollution, and fisheries management policies.

## Dr Melinda Coleman

She has produced a lot of work on connectivity of MPAs, both empirical and using connectivity models (including just out in global change). Therefore would be a great examiner for the Black Cod chapter, plus would also have input on the rest of the thesis with her marine ecology knowledge and familiarity with connectivity studies.  Although again, she's not a academic, but has the qualifications - not sure of the procedure.

**Bio**

Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth and are arguably among the most charismatic and socio-economically important habitats in temperate waters. Kelp forests are disproportionately important to biodiversity because habitat-forming species support an astounding diversity of associated organisms (e.g. Coleman et al. 2007). Anthropogenic stressors are beginning to precipitate significant changes in algal forests globally (e.g. Coleman et al. 2008) and sustainable development and conservation of these crucial ecosystems necessitates incorporation of ecological knowledge into management strategies. My research contributes to these efforts by focusing on understanding genetic and ecological processes that structure kelp forests (Coleman et al. 2011a, b, Coleman 2013), as well as investigating human impacts on kelp forest systems (Coleman et al. 2008). A key finding of my research is that boundary current systems can be used as predictive tools for marine connectivity and this will prove important for designing networks of MPAs globally (Coleman et al. 2011). My work is among the first to forecast the impacts of climate change and ocean currents on marine connectivity and is providing the necessary information with which to adaptively manage our marine environment (Cetina Heredia et al. 2015). A critical and novel result of my recent work is the demonstration that genetic diversity is key for determining resilience and vulnerability of kelp forests to climatic stress.

## Professor Mike Kingsford

He has both the experience of larval fish ecology (empirical chapter), and is interested in reef fish connectivity. So to some extent he would be all over each chapter in my thesis, and be able to provide good insight.

**Bio**
He has published extensively on the ecology of reef fishes, jellyfishes, biological oceanography and climate change. His projects have encompassed a range of latitudes and he has edited two books on tropical and temperate ecology. He is a Chief Investigator with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Innovative Coral Reef Studies. A major focus of his research has been on connectivity of reef fish populations, environmental records in corals and fishes and deadly irukandji jellyfishes. In addition to research and leadership, he teaches undergraduate students and supervises many postgraduate students.
