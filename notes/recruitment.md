#Notes from Early Life History & Recruitment in Fish Populations

##Definitions
Recruitment: The survival of newly settled juveniles up to the time of sampling
Recruitment competence: Attaining the developmental ability to metamorphose into a juvenile

##Importance
Studying annual variation is important in small populations, the number of recruits proportional to the size of the populations is important. If there is no buffer, the population relies on recruitment. 
GOAL: Predict recruitment using model?

##Variation in recruitment
+ Variability in the time and size of reproduction
+ Timing of lunar or tidal cycles
+ Distribution of the late-stage larvae (currents?)
+ Dynamics of nearshore flow
+ Predation or feeding success?

##Questions
+ How many fish survive to recruitment age?
+ Is mortality constant, size/stage specific?
+ How does spawning size reflect recruitment - is it timing dependent?
+ How does changes in spawning seasons affect recruitment?

##Food for thought
+ Identifying traits a singular effects (interactions) or co-occuring adaptions (fraught with danger)

##Benthic vs Pelagic Spawning
The two common strategies. Benthic involes common strategies such as brooding or protecting your eggs. 

In general, benthic produce larger offspring, with shorter PLD. Are benthic breeders better recruiters (less predation, starvation?). The size of the eggs is correlated with size at hatching, developmental stage at hatching, larval duration etc. 

##Larval duration & growth
Vary amongst taxa (7 to 150+ days). Pomacentrids tend to have low PLDs, while labrids have highly variable PLDs (even within species)

Does minimising dispersel minimise mortality?
Do shorter larval durations increase self-recruitment? How do they regulate these pre-competant larval stages? (Genetic or environment?)

How do highly variable pelagic larval durations affect settlement, especially over time?

Labrids are daily spawners. 

Delayed metamorphosis? Temperature effect?

There is high variabilitu due to both environmental and genetic causes.

##Growth & Mortality
The two most important influence in the early life history of fish. Houde has a unified index(?). Size leads to different predation effects as you move between predator classes. 
Fuiman & Higgs have an ontogenetic metric.
Simplification of predator-prey relationships - when is it ok?
We know that there is high variability in mortality rates, though it is very high (99%?). Two big factors are temperature & size. Temperature could explain 50% of the variability (Houde 1989a). Pepin 1991, showed that size also explains a lot of larval mortality. 
Larger larvae suffer lower mortality.

##Out of scope
+ The factors that lead to spawning variation (size, age of fish)
+ Post-settlement processes (such as predation)
