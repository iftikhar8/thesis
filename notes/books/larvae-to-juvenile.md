Is ontogeny saltatory or gradual?
Saltatory ontogeny for swimming at depth, requires a tail fin.

We are looking at indirectly developing fish (direct development is from egg to juvenile).

No all marine species obviously have a planktonic marine stage.

The larvae phase can be thought of as like a tadpole for frogs, metamorphosis occurs to create the juvenile. A fish larva is the same as a caterpillar larva.

Egg -> Embryo -> Larva -> Juvenile -> Adult -> Senescence

Should the use of noun as an adjective be discouraged?  

Epigenesis can define how the larva is born, based on the volume and density of yolk produced (altricial = less yolk or precocial = more yolk)
