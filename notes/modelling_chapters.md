#Modelling chapters proposal
---
#1. Theory chapter

Vertical movement in the water column and how it affects dispersal. 

---
#Scope
Major theme: Compare different movement behaviours for fish
 - Diel, ontogenetic, vertical & horizontal swimming
 - Combinatorial approach (=16 including passive)
 
Minor theme: Compare different implementations of ontogenetic migration. 

---

#Hypothesis

##Major
Expectation is they will all show unique patterns as they all influence the movement in different ways

##Minor
I also expect that while implementation will slightly change the values, I do not expect there to be significant differences and they all try and achieve the same outcomes

---
#Movement comparison

##Methods: 
- Model a generic fish, with only the implemented behaviours to change
- Use same random number generator (or run multiple trials?) 
- Release at 10 (equi-distant or random?) sites along the east Australian coast

##Visualising Results:
Compare on metrics of: 
- connectivity (self-recruitment, local-retention & connectivity success)
- dispersal (distance & spread)

QUESTION. How to compare 5 different response metrics and 16 model runs?
- nMDS
- Can I capture all 5 response variables in a linear model? 

---
#Implementation comparison

Methods: 

Again compare metrics.

##Applied chapter
---
+ Connectivity between marine estates in Australia
---
###Scope
Look at the new Federal marine parks and the state marine parks on the east-Australian coast. Choosing the marine species will be key, but also interesting to see if how these areas connect to each other. Doesn't necessarily all have to be representative of fish, can also include commercial invertebrate species such as mussels, abalone? Options are to look at at large area, or just focus on one state at a time and then compare between SA, VIC, NSW. 

Implement the vertical migration of several species if we know it (or just use the general patterns that we found, with different PLDs). Therefore can cover a wide range of (generic) fish species. 
---
###Questions
Are they well connected for all species, or a subset of species?
What species benefit from the current arrangements & what species do not? 
Are the marine parks well connected (e.g. number of isolated sites, sinks, sources). 
Aim is not to get political about it, just report on connectivity for a few species. Aim to use generic species to be cover a wide range.
