  Understanding the connectivity between populations has important conservation implications in the design of marine protected areas. This project models these connectivity patterns using a biophysical model and specifically focuses on the traits of pelagic larvae that influence connectivity. A meta-analysis was firstly undertaken to investigate the traits that affect, connectivity patterns, by comparing common metrics across published studies. The lack of common metrics made analyses difficult, yet provided a useful framework on the outputs for future consideration when describing connectivity studies. The empirical chapter, in turn, focused on two identified outputs of ontogenetic stage and length, and used these to predict the depth of larvae in the water column, for seven common reef associated taxa. Ichthyoplankton were collected off the NSW coast at three different depths (0-5m, 5-50m, 50-100m) and assessed for ontogenetic stage (pre-flexion, flexion or post-flexion) and measured for total length (mm). Next, the theoretical chapter modelled the effects of known swimming behaviours of larval fish on connectivity, specifically ontogenetic vertical migration, diel vertical migration, and orientated swimming. Comparing the influence of known swimming behaviour on connectivity allows us to better determine the focus of efforts when collecting empirical data and implementing these behaviours in connectivity modelling studies.  Finally, the applied chapter used these biophysical models to identify potential connectivity patterns of the threatened black cod (*Epinephelus daemelii*), and sought to determine if the Commonwealth marine parks (specifically the Temperate East Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network) fulfil the goal of protecting this vulnerable species or if important connectivity to larval settling areas are not captured within the current framework.
